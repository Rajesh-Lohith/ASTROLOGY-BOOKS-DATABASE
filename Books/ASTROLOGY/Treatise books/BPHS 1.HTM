<h2><a name=1>Ch. 1. The Creation</a></h2>

<p>I prostrate before the lotus-feet of Lord Vighneswara,
offspring of Uma, the cause of destruction of sorrow, who is
served by Mah&#257;bhutas (the five great elements of the
universe) etc., who has the face of a tusker and who consumes
the essence of Kapittha and Jambu fruits.</p>

<p>1-4. Offering his obeisance to all-knowing Mah&#257;rishi
Par&#257;&#347;ar and with folded hands, Maitreya said: “O
venerable Mah&#257;rishi, Jyotish, the supreme limb of the
Vedas, has three divisions, viz. Hor&#257;, Ganita and Samhita.
Among the said three divisions Hor&#257;, or the general part of
Jyotish is still more excellent. I desire to know of its
glorious aspects from you. Be pleased to tell me, how this
Universe is created? How does it end? What is the relationship
of the animals, born on this earth, with the heavenly bodies?
Please speak elaborately”</p>

<p>5-8. Mah&#257;rishi Par&#257;&#347;ar answered. O Brahmin,
your query has an auspicious purpose in it for the welfare of
the Universe. Praying Lord Brahma and &#346;r&#299;
Sarasvat&#299;, his power (and consort) and S&#363;rya, the
leader of the Grahas and the cause of Creation, I shall proceed
to narrate to you the science of Jyotish, as heard through Lord
Brahma. Only good will follow the teaching of this Vedic Science
to the students, who are peacefully disposed, who honour the
preceptors (and elders), who speak only truth and are
godfearing. Woeful forever, doubtlessly, will it be to impart
knowledge of this science to an unwilling student, to a
heterodox and to a crafty person.</p>

<p>9-12. &#346;r&#299; Vishnu, who is the Lord (of all matters),
who has undefiled spirit, who is endowed with the three Gunas,
although he transcends the grip of Gunas (Gunatita), who is the
Author of this Universe, who is glorious, who is the Cause and
who is endowed with valour, has no beginning. He authored the
Universe and administers it with a quarter of his power. The
other three quarters of Him, filled with nectar, are knowable
only to the philosophers (of maturity). The Principal Evolver,
who is both perceptible and imperceptible in Vasudeva. The
Imperceptible part of the Lord is endowed with dual powers,
while the Perceptible with triple powers.</p>

<p>13-15. The three powers are &#346;r&#299; Shakti (Mother
Lakshmi) with Sattva-Gun, Bh&#363; Shakti (Mother-Earth) with
Rajo-Gun and N&#299;l Shakti with Tamo-Gun. Apart from the
three, the fourth kind of Vishnu, influenced by &#346;r&#299;
Shakti and Bhoo Shakti, assumes the form of Shankarshan with
Tamo-Gun, of Pradyumna with Rajo-Gun and of Anirudh with
Sattva-Gun.</p>

<p>16-17. Mahatatwa, Ahamkar and Ahamkar Murti and Brahma, are
born from Shankarshan, Pradyumna and Anirudh, respectively. All
these three forms are endowed with all the three Gunas, with
predominance of the Gun due to their origin.</p>

<p>18-19. Ahamkar is of three classes, i.e.  with Sattvic,
Rajasic and Tamasic dispositions. Divine class, sensory organs
and the five primordial compounds (space, air, fire, water and
earth) are, respectively, from the said three Ahamkaras.</p>

<p>20. Lord Vishnu, coupled with &#346;r&#299; Shakti, rules
over the three worlds. Coupled with Bhoo Shakti, He is Brahma
causing the Universe. Coupled with Neel Shakti, He is Shiva,
destroying the Universe.</p>

<p>21-24. The Lord is in all beings and the entire Universe is
in Him. All beings contain both Jivatma and
Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347;as. Some have predominance of the
former, while yet some have the latter in predominance.
Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347; is predominant in the Grahas, viz.
S&#363;rya etc. and Brahma, Shiva and others. Their powers, or
consorts too have predominance of Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347;.
Others have more of Jivatm&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<h2><a name=2>Ch. 2. Great Incarnations</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya: “O Mah&#257;rishi Par&#257;&#347;ar, are the
incarnations of Vishnu, viz. &#346;r&#299; Ram, &#346;r&#299;
Krishn etc., endowed with Jiv&#257;&#324;&#347;?</p>

<p>2. Maharishi Parashar: “O Brahmin, the four incarnations,
viz. Ram, Krishn, Narasimh and Varah are wholly with
Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347;. The other incarnations (than these,
out of the ten) have in them Jiv&#257;&#324;&#347; too.</p>

<p>3-4. The unborn Lord has many incarnations.  He has
incarnated, as the 9 (Nava) Grahas to bestow on the living
beings the results due to their Karmas. He is Janardan. He
assumed the auspicious form of Grahas to destroy the demons
(evil forces) and sustain the divine beings.</p>

<p>5-7. From S&#363;rya the incarnation of Ram, from Candr that
of Krishn, from Mangal that of Narasimh, from Budh that of
Buddha, from Guru that of Vaman, from &#346;ukr that of
Parashuram, from &#346;ani that of Kurma (Tortoise), from Rahu
that of Varah (Pig) and from Ketu that of Meen (Fish) occurred.
All other incarnations than these also are through the Grahas.
The beings with more Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347; are called
divine beings.</p>

<p>8-13. The beings with more Jivatm&#257;&#324;&#347; are
(mortal) beings. The high degree of Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347;
from the Grahas, viz. S&#363;rya etc. did incarnate, as Ram,
Krishn etc. After completing the mission, the
Paramatm&#257;&#324;&#347;as (of the respective) Grahas again
merge (in the respective) Grahas. The Jivatma portions from the
Grahas take births, as human beings and live their lives
according to their Karmas and again merge in the Grahas. And at
the time of Great Destruction the Grahas as well merge in Lord
Vishnu. The one, who knows of all these, will become versed in
the knowledge of the past, present and future. Without a
knowledge of Jyotish these cannot be known. Hence, everyone
should have a knowledge of Jyotish, particularly the Brahmin.
The one, who, devoid of knowledge of Jyotish, blames this Vedic
Science will go to the hell called ‘Raurava’ and will be reborn
blind.</p>

<h2><a name=3>Ch. 3. Grah Characters and Description</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya: “O Mah&#257;rishi, you have affectionately
explained about the incarnations of Grahas. Now kindly detail
their characters and dispositions.</p>

<p>2-3. Para&#347;ar: “O Brahmin, listen to the account of
placement of the heavenly bodies. Out of the many luminous
bodies sighted in the skies some are stars, yet some are Grahas.
Those, that have no movements, are the Nakshatras
(asterisms).</p>

<p>4-6. Those are called ‘Grahas’, that move through the
Nakshatras (or stellar mansions) in the zodiac. The said zodiac
comprises of 27 Nakshatras commencing from Ashvini. The same
area is divided in 12 parts equal to 12 ‘R&#257;&#347;is’
commencing from Mesh. The names of the Grahas commence from
S&#363;rya. The R&#257;&#347;i rising is known, as ‘Lagn’.
Based on Lagn and the Grahas, joining and departing from each
other, the native’s good and bad effects are deducted.</p>

<p>Addition from Santhanam till Sloka 7. The names of the 27
Nakshatras are Ashvini, Bharani, Krittika, Rohini, Mrigasira,
Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Aslesha, Magha, Purvaphalguni,
Uttaraphalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, Vishaka, Anuradha,
Jyeshtha, Mula, Purvashadh, Uttarashadh, Shravana, Dhanishtha,
Satabhisha, Purvabhadra, Uttarabhadra, Revati.</p>

<p>Lagn is a very important point in the horoscope. It is the
R&#257;&#347;i, that rises in the East, on the latitude of
birth. The apparent rising of a R&#257;&#347;i is due to the
rotation of the earth on its own axis at a rate of motion,
causing every degree of the zodiac seemingly ascend on the
eastern horizon.</p>

<p>Approximately, two hours are required for a R&#257;&#347;i to
pass via the horizon, thereby every degree taking four minutes
to ascend. This duration, however, is actually dependent on the
concerned latitude.</p>

<p>Actually S&#363;rya has no motion. His motion is an apparent
one, as viewed from the rotating earth. Other Grahas, including
the nodes, have varied rates of motion. The average daily
motions of the Grahas, which are not, however standard, are, as
follows: S&#363;rya 1, Candr 13-15, Mangal 30-45’, Budh 65-100’,
&#346;ukr 62-82’, Guru 5-15’, &#346;ani 2’, Rahu/Ketu 3’.</p>

<p>With such different motions, a Grah forms various Drishtis
with others. These Drishtis through longitudinal distances have
a great deal of utility in Jyotish. This is what Maharishi
Parashar suggests to be considered.</p>

<p>7. Details (of astronomical nature) of stars have to be
understood by general rules, while I narrate to you about the
effects of Grahas and R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>8-9. The positions of the Grahas for a given time be taken,
as per Drikganit. And with the help of R&#257;&#347;i durations,
applicable to the respective places, Lagn at birth should be
known.  Now, I tell you about the castes, descriptions and
dispositions of the Grahas.</p>

<p>10. Names of Grahas. The names of the nine Grahas,
respectively, are S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru,
&#346;ukr, &#346;ani, Rahu and Ketu.</p>

<p>11. Benefics and Malefics. Among these, S&#363;rya,
&#346;ani, Mangal, decreasing Candr, Rahu and Ketu (the
ascending and the descending nodes of Candr) are malefics, while
the rest are benefics. Budh, however, is a malefic, if he joins
a malefic.</p>

<p>Addition from Santhanam till Sloka 12-13.  When Candr is
ahead of S&#363;rya, but within 120, she has medium strength.
Between 120 to 240 she is very auspicious,( see
‘Atishubhapred’). From 240 to 0 she is bereft of strength. This
is Yavanas’ view, vide P. 70 of my English Translation of
Saravali. This view is, however, related to Candr’s strength, or
otherwise, while waning Candr (Krishna Paksh, dark half) is a
malefic and waxing Candr (Shukla Paksh, bright half) is a
benefic. Should Candr be Yuti with a benefic, or receiving a
Drishti from a benefic, she turns a benefic, even if in a waning
state. As regards Budh, we have clear instructions from
Maharishi Parashar, that he becomes a malefic, if he joins a
malefic. If waning Candr and Budh are together, both are
benefics.</p>

<p>12-13. Grah governances. S&#363;rya is the soul of all. Candr
is the mind. Mangal is one’s strength. Budh is speech-giver,
while Guru confers Knowledge and happiness. &#346;ukr governs
semen (potency), while &#346;ani denotes grief.</p>

<p>14-15. Grah cabinet. Of royal status are S&#363;rya and
Candr, while Mangal is the Army chief. Prince-apparent is Budh.
The ministerial Grahas are Guru and &#346;ukr. &#346;ani is a

<p>16-17. Complexions of Grahas. S&#363;rya is blood-red. Candr
is tawny. Mangal, who is not very tall is blood-red, while
Budh’s hue is akin to that of green grass. Tawny, variegated and
dark are Guru, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani in their order.</p>

<p>18. Deities of Grahas. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fire (Agni)</i> (?), Water (Varuna), Subrahmanya (Lord
Shiva’s son, following Ganesh), Maha Vishnu, Indra, Shachi Devi
(the consort of Lord Indra) and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brahma</i> (?) are the
presiding deities of the 7 Grahas in their order.</p>

<p>19. Gender of the Grahas. Budh and &#346;ani are neuters.
Candr and &#346;ukr are females, while S&#363;rya, Mangal and
Guru are males.</p>

<p>20. Primordial compounds. The Panchabhutas, space, air, fire,
water and earth, are, respectively, governed by Guru, &#346;ani,
Mangal, &#346;ukr and Budh.</p>

<p>21. Castes of Grahas. Guru and &#346;ukr are Brahmins.
S&#363;rya is a royal Grah, while Candr and Budh belong to
commercial community. &#346;ani rules the Sudras (4<sup>th</sup>
caste).</p>

<p>22. Sattvic Grahas are the luminaries and Guru, &#346;ukr and
Budh are Rajasik, while Mangal and &#346;ani are Tamasic.</p>

<p>23. Description of S&#363;rya. S&#363;rya’s eyes are
honey-coloured. He has a square body. He is of clean habits,
bilious, intelligent and has limited hair (on his head).</p>

<p>24. Description of Candr. Candr is very windy and phlegmatic.
She is learned and has a round body. She has auspicious looks
and sweet speech, is fickle-minded and very lustful.</p>

<p>25. Description of Mangal.  Mangal has blood-red eyes, is
fickle-minded, liberal, bilious, given to anger and has thin
waist and thin physique.</p>

<p>26. Description of Budh. Budh is endowed with an attractive
physique and the capacity to use words with many meanings.  He
is fond of jokes. He has a mix of all the three humours.</p>

<p>27. Description of Guru. Guru has a big body, tawny hair and
tawny eyes, is phlegmatic, intelligent and learned in

<p>32. Abodes of the Grahas. Temple, watery place, place of
fire, sport-ground, treasure-house, bed-room and filthy ground:

S&#363;rya onward.</p>

<p>33. Grah periods. Ayan, Muhurta, a day (consisting day and

Guru. S&#363;rya and Mangal are so in the South, while &#346;ani
is the only Grah, that derives strength in the West. Candr and
&#346;ukr are endowed with vigour, when in the North. Again,
strong during night are Candr, Mangal and &#346;ani, while Budh
is strong during day and night.  The rest (i.e. Guru, S&#363;rya
and &#346;ukr) are strong only in daytime.  During the dark half
malefics are strong. Benefics acquire strength in the bright
half of the month. Malefics and benefics are, respectively,
strong in Dakshinayan and Uttarayan. The Lords of the year,
month, day and Hora (hour of Grah) are stronger than the other
in ascending order. Again, stronger than the other in the
ascending are &#346;ani, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr, Candr
and S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>39-40. Related to trees. S&#363;rya rules strong trees (i.e.
trees with stout trunks), &#346;ani useless trees, Candr milky
trees (and rubber yielding plants), Mangal bitter ones (like
lemon plants), &#346;ukr floral plants, Guru fruitful ones and
Budh fruitless ones.</p>

<p>41-44. Other matters. Rahu rules the outcaste, while Ketu
governs mixed caste. &#346;ani and the nodes indicate ant-hills.
Rahu denotes multi-coloured clothes and Ketu rags. Lead and blue
gem belong to Rahu and Ketu. S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh,
Guru, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani in their order govern red silken,
white silken, red, black silken, saffron, silken and
multi-coloured robes.</p>

<p>45-46. Seasons of Grahas. Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsh, Sarad,
Hemanta and Sisir are the six Ritus (or seasons), respectively,
governed by &#346;ukr, Mangal, Candr, Budh, Guru and &#346;ani.
Rahu and Ketu denote 8 months and 3 months, respectively.</p>

<p>47. Dhatu, Mool and Jiva Divisions. Dhatu Grahas are Rahu,
Mangal, &#346;ani and Candr, while S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr are
Mula Grahas. Budh, Guru and Ketu rule Jivas.</p>

<p>48. Age. Out of all the Grahas &#346;ani is the eldest. He
bestows maximum number of years in Naisargik Dasha.</p>

<p>49-50. Exaltation and Debilitation. For the seven Grahas,
from S&#363;rya on, the exaltation R&#257;&#347;is are,
respectively, Mesh, Vrishabh, Makar, Kanya, Kark, Meen and Tula.
The deepest exaltation degrees are, respectively, 10, 3, 28, 15,
5, 27 and 20 in those R&#257;&#347;is. And in the seventh
R&#257;&#347;i from the said exaltation R&#257;&#347;i each Grah
has its own debilitation. The same degrees of deep exaltation
apply to deep fall.</p>

<p>51-54. Additional Dignities. In Simh the first 20 degrees are
S&#363;rya’s Mooltrikon, while the rest is his own Bhava.  After
the first 3 degrees of exaltation portion in Vrishabh, for
Candr, the rest is her Mooltrikon. Mangal has the first 12
degrees in Mesh, as Mooltrikon with the rest therein becoming
simply his own Bhava. For Budh, in Kanya the first 15 degrees
are exaltation zone, the next 5 degrees Mooltrikon and the last
10 degrees are own Bhava. The first one third of Dhanu is the
Mooltrikon of Guru, while the remaining part thereof is his own
Bhava.  &#346;ukr divides Tula into two halves keeping the
first, as Mooltrikon and the second, as own Bhava. &#346;ani’s
arrangements are same in Kumbh, as S&#363;rya has in Simh.</p>

<p>55. Natural Relationships. Note the R&#257;&#347;is, which
are the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> from the
Mooltrikon of a Grah. The Grahas ruling such R&#257;&#347;is are
its friends, apart from the Lord of its exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i. Lords other than these are its enemies.  If a
Grah becomes its friend as well, as its enemy (on account of the
said two computations), then it is neutral, or equal.</p>

<p>56. Temporary Relationships. The Grah, posited in the
2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>,
11<sup>th</sup>, or the 12<sup>th</sup> from another, becomes a
mutual friend.  There is enmity otherwise. (This applies to a
given Janm Kundali)</p>

<p>57-58. Compound Relationship. Should two Grahas be naturally
and temporarily friendly, they become extremely friendly.
Friendship on one count and neutrality on another count make
them friendly.  Enmity on one count combined with affinity on
the other turns into equality.  Enmity and neutralship cause
only enmity. Should there be enmity in both manners, extreme
enmity is obtained. The Jyotishi should consider these and
declare horoscopic effects accordingly.</p>

<p>59-60. Ratio of Effects. A Grah in exaltation gives fully
good effects, while in Mooltrikon it is bereft of its auspicious
effects by one fourth. It is half beneficial in its own Bhava.
Its beneficence is one fourth in a friendly R&#257;&#347;i. In
an equal’s R&#257;&#347;i one eighth of auspicious disposition
is useful. The good effects are nil in debilitation, or enemy’s
camp. Inauspicious effects are quite reverse with reference to
what is stated.</p>

<p>61-64. Non-luminous UpaGrahas (Sub-Grahas).  Add 4
R&#257;&#347;is 13 degrees and 20 minutes of arc to S&#363;rya’s
longitude at a given moment to get the exact position of the all
inauspicious Dhoom. Reduce Dhoom from 12 R&#257;&#347;is to
arrive at Vyatipat. Vyatipat is also inauspicious. Add six
R&#257;&#347;is to Vyatipat to know the position of Parivesh. He
is extremely inauspicious. Deduct Parivesh from 12
R&#257;&#347;is to arrive at the position of Chap (Indra
Dhanus), who is also inauspicious. Add 16 degrees 40 minutes to
Chap, which will give Ketu (UpaKetu), who is a malefic. By
adding a R&#257;&#347;i to UpaKetu, you get the original
longitude of S&#363;rya. These are the Grahas, devoid of
splendour, which are malefics by nature and cause
affliction.</p>

<p>65. Effects of Sub-Grahas. If one of these afflicts
S&#363;rya, the native’s dynasty will decline, while Candr and
Lagn, respectively, associated with one of these, will destroy
the longevity and wisdom. So declared Lord Brahma, the
Lotus-Born.</p>

<p>66-69. Calculations of Gulik etc. The portions of S&#363;rya
etc. up to &#346;ani denote the periods of Gulik and others.
Divide the day duration (of any week day) into eight equal
parts. The eighth portion is Lord-less. The seven portions are
distributed to the seven Grahas commencing from the Lord of the
week day. Whichever portion is ruled by &#346;ani, will be the
portion of Gulik. Similarly make the night duration into eight
equal parts and distribute these, commencing from the Lord of
the 5<sup>th</sup> (by) week. Here again, the eighth portion is
Lord-less, while &#346;ani’s portion is Gulik. S&#363;rya’s
portion is Kaal, Mangal’s portion is Mrityu, Guru’s portion is
Yamaghantak and Budh’s portion is Ardhaprahar. These durations
differently apply to different places (commensurate with
variable day and night durations).</p>

<p>70. Gulik’s Position. The degree, ascending at the time of
start of Gulik’s portion (as above), will be the longitude of
Gulik at a given place. Based on this longitude only, Gulik’s
effects for a particular nativity be estimated.</p>

<p>71-74. Calculation of Pranapad. Convert the given time into
Vighatis and divide the same by 15. The resultant
R&#257;&#347;i, degrees etc. be added to S&#363;rya, if he is in
a Movable R&#257;&#347;i, which will yield Pranapad. If
S&#363;rya is in a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i, add 240 degrees
additionally and, if in a Dual R&#257;&#347;i, add 120 degrees
in furtherance to get Pranapad. The birth will be auspicious, if
Pranapad falls in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>,
9<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, or
11<sup>th</sup> from the natal Lagn. In other Bhavas Pranapad
indicates an inauspicious birth.</p>

<p>Notes. Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak, Mrityu, Kaal and Gulik are
the 5 Kaal Velas, suggested by Maharishi Parashar. The day
duration, according to altitude, is divided into eight equal
parts. The eighth portion is unlorded. The first portion is
allotted to the weekday Lord. Other portions follow in the order
of weekday Lords. We consider 5 portions of Grahas, ignoring
that of Candr and &#346;ukr. The portions of S&#363;rya, Mangal,
Budh, Guru and &#346;ani are, respectively, called Kaal, Mrityu,
Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak and Gulik.</p>

<p>In the case of night the durations, or 1/8<sup>th</sup> parts
are allotted in a different order. The first portion goes to the
Grah, ruling the 5<sup>th</sup> weekday Lord, counted from the
day in question. The others follow in the usual order. Here
again, the 8<sup>th</sup> part is Lord-less. The portions of
Grahas from Kaal to Gulik are the same in nomenclature in the
night also.</p>

<p>Keeranuru NataRaja of Jatakalankaram (Tamil version) gives
R&#257;&#347;is of dignities for these UpaGrahas and Gulik etc.
(UpaGrah &amp; Gulik etc.: Exaltation, Debilitation, Swakshetra
(own R&#257;&#347;i)) Dhoom: Simh, Kumbh, Makar; Vyatipat:
Vrischik, Vrishabh, Mithun; Parivesh: Mithun, Dhanu, Dhanu;
Indrachap: Dhanu, Mithun, Kark; UpaKetu:  Kumbh, Simh, Kark;
Gulik: -, -, Kumbh; Yamaghantak: -, -, Dhanu; Ardhaprahar:  -,
-, Mithun; Kaal: -, -, Makar; Mrityu: -, -, Vrischik.</p>

<p>From S&#363;rya to &#346;ani no one is exalted in the
above-mentioned exaltation R&#257;&#347;is, nor debilitated in
the above-mentioned debilitation R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>Out of the 5 Kaal Velas, viz. Gulik etc., four except Kaal
(related to S&#363;rya) have their own R&#257;&#347;i system in
the respective R&#257;&#347;is, ruled by their fathers. Gulik,
son of &#346;ani, has Kumbh, as his own Bhava. Guru’s son,
Yamaghantak, has it in Dhanu. Ardhaprahar, Budh’s son, is in own
R&#257;&#347;i, if in Mithun. Mrityu, son of Mangal, has
Vrischik, as own Bhava. It is not known, why Kaal, a son of
S&#363;rya shifted to Makar, a R&#257;&#347;i of his brother
(&#346;ani), leaving his father’s Simh. Obviously, &#346;ani has
given his Mooltrikon to his son Gulik, while he gave Makar (a
secondary R&#257;&#347;i) to his ‘brother’ Kaal.</p>

<h2><a name=4>Ch. 4. Zodiacal R&#257;&#347;is Described</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Importance of Hora. The word Hora is derived from
Ahoratr after dropping the first and last syllables. Thus Hora
(Lagnas) remains in between Ahoratr (i.e. day and night) and
after knowing Hora the good and bad effects of a native be
known. &#346;r&#299; Vishnu, the Invisible is Time personified.
His limbs are the 12 R&#257;&#347;is, commencing from Mesh.</p>

<p>3. Names of R&#257;&#347;is. The 12 R&#257;&#347;is of the
zodiac in order are Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya,
Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh and Meen.</p>

<p>4-4&frac12;. Limbs of Kaal Purush. Kaal Purush (or Time

is footless and has a medium build. It rules the North and rises
with both head and back. It is ruled by Guru. This is how the
twelve R&#257;&#347;is, each of 30 degrees extent, are described
to evaluate gross and specific effects.</p>

<p>25-30. Nishek Lagn. O excellent of Brahmins, now is a step
explained to arrive at the Nishek Lagn, when the natal Lagn is
known. Note the angular distance between &#346;ani and Mandi
(Gulik).  Add this to the difference between the Lagn Bhava
(Madhya, or cusp) and the 9<sup>th</sup> Bhava (cusp). The
resultant product in R&#257;&#347;is, degrees etc. will
represent the months, days etc., that elapsed between Nishek and
birth. At birth, if Lagn Lord is in the invisible half (i.e.
from Lagn cusp to descendental cusp), add the degrees etc.,
Candr moved in the particular R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by her,
to the above-mentioned product. Then Lagn at Nishek can be
worked out and the good and bad, experienced by the native in
the womb, can be guessed. One can also guess with the help of
Nishek Lagn effects, like longevity, death etc. of the
parents.</p>

<h2><a name=5>Ch. 5. Special Lagnas</a></h2>

<p>1. Oh excellent of the Brahmins, I explain below again some
special Lagnas, viz. Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn and Ghati Lagn.</p>

<p>2-3. Bhava Lagn. From sunrise to the time of birth every 5
Ghatis (or 120 minutes) constitute one Bhava Lagn. Divide the
time of birth (in Ghatis, Vighatis etc.) from sunrise by 5 and
add the quotient etc. to S&#363;rya’s longitude, as at sunrise.
This is called Bhava Lagn.</p>

<p>4-5. Hora Lagn. Again from sunrise till the time of birth
Hora Lagn repeats itself every 2&frac12; Ghatis (i. e. 60
minutes). Divide the time past up to birth from sunrise by
2&frac12; and add the quotient etc. in R&#257;&#347;is, degrees
and so on to the longitude of S&#363;rya, as at the sunrise.
This will yield Hora Lagn in R&#257;&#347;i, degrees etc.</p>

<p>6-8. Ghati Lagn (Ghatik Lagn). Now listen to the method of
working out Ghati Lagn. This Lagn changes along with every Ghati
(24 minutes) from the sunrise. Note birth time in Ghatis and
Vighatis.  Consider the number of Ghatis past, as number of
R&#257;&#347;is, or Ghati Lagnas. The Vighatis be divided by 2
to arrive at degrees and minutes of arc, past in the said Ghati
Lagn. The product so arrived in R&#257;&#347;is, degrees and
minutes be added to S&#363;rya’s longitude, as at sunrise, to
get the exact location of Ghati Lagn. So say Maharishis, like
Narada.</p>

<p>9. Use of Special Lagnas. Keeping the Grahas at birth, as it
is, prepare various Bhava Kundalis with respect to each special
Lagn and analyze, as done for the natal Lagn.</p>

<p>10-13&frac12;. Varnad Dasha. I now detail Varnad Dasha, just
by knowing which one can deal with the longevity of a native. If
the natal Lagn is an odd R&#257;&#347;i, count directly from
Mesh to natal Lagn. If the natal Lagn is an even R&#257;&#347;i,
count from Meen to the natal Lagn in the reverse order.
Similarly, if the Hora Lagn is an odd one, count from Mesh to
Hora Lagn in direct order. If the Hora Lagn is an even one,
count from Meen to Hora Lagn in the reverse order. If both the
products are odd R&#257;&#347;is, or even R&#257;&#347;is, then
add both the figures. If one is odd and the other is even, then
know the difference between the two products.  If the latest
product in this process is an odd one, count so many
R&#257;&#347;is from Mesh in a direct manner; if an even one,
count so many R&#257;&#347;is from Meen in reverse order. The
R&#257;&#347;i so known will be the Varnad for Lagn.</p>

<p>14-15. Effects of Varnad. Now listen to the use of the above.
Out of the two, viz. natal Lagn and Hora Lagn, whichever is
stronger, from there Varnad starts. If the natal Lagn is an odd
R&#257;&#347;i, the counting of Dashas is clockwise, otherwise
anticlockwise. Lagn Dasha years will equal the number of
R&#257;&#347;is, intervening between the natal Lagn and Varnad.
Similarly for other Bhavas.</p>

<p>16-20. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Should a Kon from Lagn’s
Varnad be occupied, or drishtied by a malefic, the native will
live only up to the Dasha of the said R&#257;&#347;i. Just, as
the Rudra Grah in Sool Dasha is capable of causing evils, the
above-mentioned Grahas related to Varnad’s Kon be treated. The
Varnad Lagn be considered, as natal Lagn, while the
7<sup>th</sup> from Varnad will denote the longevity of the
spouse, the 11<sup>th</sup> longevity of elder brothers and
sisters, the 3<sup>rd</sup> longevity of younger brothers and
sisters, the 5<sup>th</sup> the longevity of sons, the
4<sup>th</sup> longevity of mother and the 9<sup>th</sup>
longevity of father. The Dasha of the Sool R&#257;&#347;i will
inflict greater evils.</p>

<p>21-24. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Similar assessments be made
with reference to the Varnad of each Bhava, commencing the
first, and the evils and goods due to a nativity be known. These
Varnad Dashas are only for Bhavas (R&#257;&#347;is) and not
their occupants. The sub period of each Dasha will be one
twelfth of the Dasha and the order will also be clockwise, or
anti-clockwise, as explained earlier. The natal Lagn is to be
calculated according to birth place, while Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn
etc. are common to all places.</p>

<h2><a name=6>Ch. 6. The Sixteen Divisions of a R&#257;&#347;i</a></h2>

<p>1. O Mah&#257;rishi Par&#257;&#347;ar, I have known from you
about the Grahas, R&#257;&#347;is and their descriptions. I
desire to know the details of various divisions of a
R&#257;&#347;i, will you please narrate.</p>

<p>2-4. Names of the 16 Vargas. Lord Brahma has described 16
kinds of Vargas (Divisions) for each R&#257;&#347;i. Listen to
those. The names are R&#257;&#347;i, Hor&#257;, Dreshkan,
Chaturth&#257;&#324;&#347;, Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, Dash&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347;, Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Vimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, Chaturvimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Saptavimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Khaved&#257;&#324;&#347;, Akshaved&#257;&#324;&#347; and
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>5-6. R&#257;&#347;i and Hor&#257;. The R&#257;&#347;i, owned
by a Grah, is called its Kshetra. The first half of an odd
R&#257;&#347;i is the Hora, ruled by S&#363;rya. While the
second half is the Hora of Candr. The reverse is true in the
case of an even R&#257;&#347;i.  Half of a R&#257;&#347;i is
called Hora. These are totally 24, counted from Mesh and
repeated twice (at the rate of 12) in the whole of the
zodiac.</p>

<p>7-8. Dreshkan. One third of a R&#257;&#347;i is called
Dreshkan. These are totally 36, counted from Mesh, repeating
thrice at the rate of 12 per round. The 1<sup>st</sup>,
5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;is from a
R&#257;&#347;i are its three Dreshkanas and are, respectively,
lorded by Narada, Agasthya and Durvash.</p>

<p>9. Chaturth&#257;&#324;&#347;. The Lords of the 4 Kendras
from a R&#257;&#347;i are the rulers of respective
Chaturth&#257;&#324;&#347; of a R&#257;&#347;i, commencing from
Mesh. Each Chaturth&#257;&#324;&#347; is one fourth of a
R&#257;&#347;i. The deities, respectively, are Sanak, Sanand,
Kumar and Sanatan.</p>

<p>10-11. Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;. The Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;
(one seventh of a R&#257;&#347;i) counting commences from the
same R&#257;&#347;i in the case of an odd R&#257;&#347;i. It is
from the seventh R&#257;&#347;i thereof, while an even
R&#257;&#347;i is considered.  The names of the seven divisions
in odd R&#257;&#347;is are Kshaar Ksheer, Dadhi, Ghrith, Ikshu,
Ras, Madhya and Suddh Jal. These designations are reversed for
an even R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>12. Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;. The Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;
calculation are for a Movable R&#257;&#347;i from there itself,
for a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i from the 9<sup>th</sup> thereof and
for a Dual R&#257;&#347;i from the 5<sup>th</sup> thereof. They
go by designations Deva (divine), Manushya (human) and Rakshasa
(devilish) in a successive and repetitive order for a Movable
R&#257;&#347;i. (Manushya, Rakshasa and Deva are the order for a
Fixed R&#257;&#347;i, while Rakshasa, Manushya and Deva are a
Dual R&#257;&#347;i’s order)</p>

<p>13-14. Dash&#257;&#324;&#347;. Starting from the same
R&#257;&#347;i for an odd R&#257;&#347;i and from the
9<sup>th</sup> with reference to an even R&#257;&#347;i, the 10
Dash&#257;&#324;&#347;as, each of 3 degrees, are reckoned. These
are presided over by the ten rulers of the cardinal directions,
viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Rakshasa, Varuna, Vayu, Kuber, Isan,
Brahma and Ananth in case of an odd R&#257;&#347;i. It is in the
reverse order, that these presiding deities are reckoned, when
an even R&#257;&#347;i is given.</p>

<p>15. Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347;. The reckoning of the
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347; (one twelfth of a R&#257;&#347;i, or
2&frac12; degrees each) commences from the same R&#257;&#347;i.
In each R&#257;&#347;i the presidentship repeats thrice in the
order of Ganesh, Ashvini Kumar, Yama and Sarpa for the 12
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347;as.</p>

<p>16. Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347; (or Kal&#257;&#324;&#347;).
Starting from Mesh for a Movable R&#257;&#347;i, from Simh for a
Fixed R&#257;&#347;i and from Dhanu for a Dual R&#257;&#347;i,
the 16 Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347;as (16<sup>th</sup> part of a
R&#257;&#347;i, i.e.  of 1°52’30”) are regularly distributed.
The presiding deities of these repeat in the order Brahma,
Vishnu, Shiva and S&#363;rya four times in the case of an odd
R&#257;&#347;i. It is reverse in the case of an even
R&#257;&#347;i, that these ruling deities are understood.</p>

<p>17-21. Vimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;. From Mesh for a Movable
R&#257;&#347;i, from Dhanu for a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i and from
Simh for a Common R&#257;&#347;i: this is how the calculations
of Vimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;as (1/20<sup>th</sup> of a
R&#257;&#347;i, or 1°30’ each) are to commence. The presiding
deities of the 20 Vimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;as in an odd
R&#257;&#347;i are, respectively: Kali, Gauri, Jaya, Lakshmi,
Vijaya, Vimal, Sati, Tara, Jvalamukhi, Sveta, Lalita,
Bagalamukhi, Pratyangir, Shachi, Raudri, Bhavani, Varad, Jaya,
Tripura and Sumukhi. In an even R&#257;&#347;i these 20 deities,
respectively, are Daya, Megha, Chinnasi, Pisachini, Dhumavathi,
Matangi, Bal, Bhadr, Arun, Anal, Pingal, Chuchchuk, Ghora,
Vaarahi, Vaishnavi, Sita, Bhuvanesvari, Bhairavi, Mangal and
Aparajit.</p>

<p>22-23. Chaturvimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;. The
Chaturvimsh&#257;&#324;&#347; (1/24<sup>th</sup> part of a
R&#257;&#347;i, or 1°15’ each) distribution commences from Simh
and Kark, respectively, for an odd and an even R&#257;&#347;i.
In the case of an odd R&#257;&#347;i the ruling deities repeat
twice in the order of Skand, Parusdhar, Anal, Vishwakarma, Bhag,
Mitr, Maya, Antaka, Vrisha-Dwaja, Govinda, Madan and Bhima.
Reverse these from Bhima twice to know the deities for the
Chaturvimsh&#257;&#324;&#347; in an even R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>24-26. Saptavimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;
(Nakshatr&#257;&#324;&#347;, or Bh&#257;&#324;&#347;). The
Saptavimsh&#257;&#324;&#347; Lords are, respectively, the
presiding deities of the 27 Nakshatras, as under: Dastra
(Ashvini Kumar), Yama, Agni, Brahma, Candr, Isa, Adhiti, Jiva,
Ahi, Pitar, Bhag, Aryama, S&#363;rya, Tvasht, Marut, Chakragni,
Mitr, Vasava, Rakshasa, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Govinda, Vasu,
Varuna, Ajap, Ahirbuddhnya and Pushya. These are for an odd
R&#257;&#347;is. Count these deities in a reverse order for an
even R&#257;&#347;i. The Saptavimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;
distribution commences from Mesh and other Movable
R&#257;&#347;is for all the 12 R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>27-28. Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;. The Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;
Lords for an odd R&#257;&#347;i are Mangal, &#346;ani, Guru,
Budh and &#346;ukr. Each of them in order rules 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5
degrees. The deities, ruling over the
Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;as, are, respectively, Agni, Vayu,
Indra, Kuber and Varuna. In the case of an even R&#257;&#347;i
the quantum of Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, Grah lordship and
deities get reversed.</p>

<p>29-30. Khaved&#257;&#324;&#347; (or
Chatvarimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, 1/40<sup>th</sup> part of a
R&#257;&#347;i). For odd R&#257;&#347;is count from Mesh and for
an even R&#257;&#347;i from Tula in respect of
Khaved&#257;&#324;&#347;as (each of 45’ of arc). Vishnu, Candr,
Marichi, Tvasht, Dhata, Shiva, Ravi, Yama, Yaksh, Gandharv, Kaal
and Varuna repeat successively, as presiding deities, in the
same order for all R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>31-32. Akshaved&#257;&#324;&#347; (1/45<sup>th</sup> part of
a R&#257;&#347;i). Mesh, Simh and Dhanu are the R&#257;&#347;is,
from which the distributions, respectively, commence for
Movable, Immovable and Common R&#257;&#347;is. In Movable
R&#257;&#347;is Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu; in Immovable
R&#257;&#347;is Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma and in Common
R&#257;&#347;is Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva repeat 15 times the
presidentship over these Akshaved&#257;&#324;&#347;as.</p>

<p>33-41. Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; (1/60<sup>th</sup> part of a
R&#257;&#347;i, or half a degree each). To calculate the
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; Lord ignore the R&#257;&#347;i
position of a Grah and take the degrees etc. it traversed in
that R&#257;&#347;i. Multiply that figure by 2 and divide the
degrees by 12. Add 1 to the remainder, which will indicate the
R&#257;&#347;i, in which the Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; falls.
The Lord of that R&#257;&#347;i is the Grah, ruling the said
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;. In odd R&#257;&#347;is the names of
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;as are 1. Ghora, 2.  Rakshasa, 3. Deva,
4. Kuber, 5. Yaksh, 6. Kindar, 7. Bhrasht, 8. Kulaghna, 9.
Garal, 10. Vahni, 11. Maya, 12. Purishak, 13. Apampathi, 14.
Marutwan, 15.  Kaal, 16. Sarpa, 17. Amrit, 18. Indu, 19. Mridu,
20. Komal, 21. Heramba, 22.  Brahma, 23. Vishnu, 24. Maheshwara,
25. Deva, 26. Ardr, 27. Kalinas, 28.  Kshitees, 29. Kamalakar,
30. Gulik, 31. Mrityu, 32. Kaal, 33. Davagni, 34.  Ghora, 35.
Yama, 36 Kantak, 37. Suddh, 38. Amrit, 39. PurnaCandr, 40.
Vishadagdha, 41. Kulanas, 42. Vamshakshaya, 43. Utpat, 44. Kaal,
45. Saumya, 46. Komal, 47. Sheetal, 48. Karaladamshtr, 49.
Candramukhi, 50. Praveen, 51.  Kaalpavak, 52. Dhannayudh, 53.
Nirmal, 54. Saumya, 55. Krur, 56. Atisheetal, 57. Amrit, 58.
Payodhi, 59. Brahman, 60. CandraRekha (InduRekha). The reverse
is the order for even R&#257;&#347;is in so much, as these names
are cased.  Grahas in benefic Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;as
produce auspicious, while the opposite is true in case of Grahas
in malefic Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;as.</p>

<p>42-53. Varg Classification. Maitreya, explained now are the
sum effects of classifications of different divisions (or
Vargas, so far narrated). These are four kinds, viz. Shad Varg,
Sapth Varg, Dasha Varg and Shodasha Varg. In the ShadVarg
classification the Varg designations are Kimshuk, Vyanjan,
Chamar, Chatr and Kundal, according to a Grah being in 2 to 6
combinations of good Vargas. Next is the Sapth Varg, in which
these classifications continue in the same manner up to six
combinations of good Vargas, the 7<sup>th</sup> additional Varg
getting classified, as Mukut. In the Dasha Varg scheme the
designations commence from Parijata etc., such as 2 good Vargas
- Parijatha, 3 Uttama, 4 Gopur, 5 Simhasan, 6 Paravata, 7
Devaloka, 8 Brahmaloka, 9 Sakravahana and 10 Vargas - Shridham.
In the Shodasha Varg scheme the combinations of Vargas go with
designations thus: two good Vargas - Bhedak, 3 Kusum, 4
Nagapushpa, 5 Kanduk, 6 Kerala, 7 Kalpa Vriksha, 8 Chandan Vana,
9 PurnaCandr, 10 Uchchaisrava, 11 Dhanvantari, 12
S&#363;ryakant, 13 Vidrum, 14 Chakra-Simhasan, 15 Golok and 16
Vargas - &#346;r&#299; Vallabh.  In these divisions the
divisions, falling in the Grah’s exaltation R&#257;&#347;i,
Mooltrikon R&#257;&#347;i, own R&#257;&#347;i and the
R&#257;&#347;is, owned by the Lord of a Kendra from the Arudha
Lagn, are all to be considered (as good Vargas). The divisions
of a combust Grah, defeated Grah, weak Grah and a Grah in bad
Avasthas, like Sayan, be all ignored to be auspicious, for these
destroy the good Yogas.</p>

<h2><a name=7>Ch. 7. Divisional Considerations</a></h2>

<p>1-8. Use of the 16 Divisions. Now I will explain the use of
these sixteen divisions. The physique from Lagn, wealth from
Hora, happiness through co-born from Dreshkan, fortunes from
Chaturth&#257;&#324;&#347;, sons and grandsons from
Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;, spouse from Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, power
(and position) from Dash&#257;&#324;&#347;, parents from
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347;, benefits and adversities through
conveyances from Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347;, worship from
Vimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, learning from
Chaturvimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, strength and weakness from
Saptavimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, evil effects from
Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;, auspicious and inauspicious effects
from Khaved&#257;&#324;&#347; and all indications from both
Akshaved&#257;&#324;&#347; and Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;: these
are the considerations to be made through the respective Vargas.
The Bhava, whose Lord is in a malefic Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347;,
will diminish; so say Garga and others. The Bhava, whose Lord is
in a benefic Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347;, flourish. This is how
the 16 Vargas are to be evaluated.</p>

<p>9-12. After assessing the 20 point strength of the ascending
degree, of other Bhavas and of the Grahas, the good and bad
effects be declared. I explain below the method of knowing the
Vimsopak strength (20 point strength), just by knowing which an
idea of the results of actions of this birth and of former birth
will clearly emerge. The Grahas from S&#363;rya on get full
strength, when in exaltation, or in own R&#257;&#347;i and are
bereft of strength, when in the 7<sup>th</sup> (from
exaltation). In between the strength be known by the rule of
three process. In the case of a Grah, owning two
R&#257;&#347;is, distinction of placement in odd/even
R&#257;&#347;i identical with own R&#257;&#347;i be made.</p>

<p>13-16. Hor&#257;, Dreshkan and Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;
Effects. Guru, S&#363;rya and Mangal give (pronounced) effects
in the Hora of S&#363;rya. Candr, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani do so,
when in Candr’s Horas; Budh is effective in both the Horas. In
the case of an even R&#257;&#347;i the Hora of Candr will be
powerful in effects, while S&#363;rya’s Hora in an odd
R&#257;&#347;i will be so. Full, medium and nil will be the
effects, respectively, in the beginning middle and the end of a
Hora. Similar applications be made for a Dreshkan,
Tury&#257;&#324;&#347;, Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; etc. As for
Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347; effects, S&#363;rya is akin to Mangal
and Candr is akin to &#346;ukr. The effects, applicable to
R&#257;&#347;i, will apply to Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>17-19. Vimshopak Bal. The Shad Vargas consist of
R&#257;&#347;i, Hora, Dreshkan, Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347; and Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;. The full
Bal for each of the divisions, respectively, are 6, 2, 4, 5, 2
and 1. This is the Vimshopak Bal, relating to Shad Varg
division. Adding the Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347; to the Shad Vargas,
we get Sapt Varg, the Vimshopak Bal for which is 5, 2, 3,
2&frac12;, 4&frac12;, 2 and 1. These are gross strengths, while
subtle ones should be understood by exact positions.</p>

<p>20. Add Dash&#257;&#324;&#347;, Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347; and
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; to the said Sapt Varg Divisions to get
the scheme of Dasha Varg. The Vimshopak Bal in this context is 3
for R&#257;&#347;i, 5 for Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; and for the
other 8 divisions 1&frac12; each.</p>

<p>21-25. When the 16 divisions (Shodash Varg Scheme) are
considered together, the Vimshopak score goes thus: Hora 1,
Trims&#257;&#324;&#347; 1, Dreshkan 1, Shodash&#257;&#324;&#347;
2, Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; 3, R&#257;&#347;i 3&frac12;,
Shashti&#257;&#324;&#347; 4 and the rest of the nine divisions
each a half. The Vimshopak Bal remains as 20, only when the Grah
is in own Bhava Vargas. Otherwise, the total strength from 20
declines to 18 in Pramudit Vargas, to 15 in Shant Vargas, to 10
in Svasth divisions, to 7 in Duhkhit Vargas and to 5 in Khal
Vargas. (These figures are called Varg Vishwa)</p>

<p>26-27. Vimshopak Proportional Evaluation.  Multiply the
figure due to full strength for the division by the Varg Vishwa
and divide by 20 to get the exact strength of the Grah. If the
total is below 5, the Grah will not be capable of giving
auspicious results. If it is above 5, but below 10, the Grah
will yield some good effects. Later on up to 15 it is indicative
of mediocre effect. A Grah with above 15 will yield wholly
favourable effects.</p>

<p>28-29. Other Sources of Strength. Maitreya, there are other
kinds of sources, as I explain below. Grahas in the
7<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya will be fully effective. One with
an identical longitude in comparison to S&#363;rya’s will
destroy the good effects. Rule of three process be applied to
the Grah in between these positions.</p>

<p>30-32. Dasha effects with Vimshopak Bal.  Maitreya, after
assessing the Vimshopak Bal through the various divisions, the
rising and setting of the Grahas be considered. The Vimshopak
Bal is classified under Purna, AtiPurna, Madhya, AtiMadhya,
Heen, AtiHeen, Swalpa and AtiSwalp.  Thus should be classified
the Vimshopak Bal and the Dasha period results declared
accordingly.</p>

<p>33-36. Kendras, Konas etc. defined. O Maitreya, listen to
other matters, which I am explaining. The Kendras are specially
known, as Lagn (the ascendent), Bandhu Bhava, Yuvati Bhava (the
descendant) and Karm Bhava (mid-heaven). Dhan, Putr, Randhr and
Labh Bhava are Panapharas (succedents), while Sahaj, Ari, Dharm
and Vyaya Bhava are called Apoklimas (cadents). Putr and Dharm
Bhava are known by the name Kon (or trine).  Evil Bhavas, or
Dusthan Bhavas are Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava. Chaturasras are
Bandhu and Randhr Bhava. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava are
Upachaya Bhavas.</p>

<p>37-38. Names of Bhavas. Thanu, Dhan, Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr,
Ari, Yuvati, Randhr, Dharm, Karma, Labh and Vyaya are in order
the names of Bhavas. I explained these briefly and leave it to
you to grasp more, according to your intelligence. As delivered
by Lord Brahma, some further information is added thus (i.e. in
the following verses).</p>

<p>39-43. Indications from Bhavas. Dharm Bhava and the
9<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya deal with one’s father. Whatever
effects are to be known from the Karm and Labh Bhava, be also
known from similar Bhavas, counted from S&#363;rya. Whatever
results are to be known from Bandhu, Tanu, Dhan, Labh and Dharm
should also be known from the 4<sup>th</sup> of Candr, from Kark
R&#257;&#347;i itself and from the 2<sup>nd</sup>,
11<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> from Candr, respectively.
Whatever has to be known through Sahaj Bhava, be also analyzed
through the 3<sup>rd</sup> from Mangal. The 6<sup>th</sup> from
Budh be also considered in regard to indications, derivable from
Ari Bhava. The 5<sup>th</sup> from Guru, the 7<sup>th</sup> from
&#346;ukr and both the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> from
&#346;ani stand for consideration, respectively, in respect of
offspring, spouse and death. The Lord of the Bhava is equally
important, when estimating the indications of a particular
Bhava.</p>

<h2><a name=8>Ch. 8. Drishtis of the R&#257;&#347;is</a></h2>

<p>1-3.  R&#257;&#347;i Drishtis. O Maitreya, now detailed are
the Drishtis, emanating from the R&#257;&#347;i Mesh etc. Every
Movable R&#257;&#347;i drishties the 3 Fixed R&#257;&#347;is,
leaving the Fixed R&#257;&#347;i adjacent to it. Every Fixed
R&#257;&#347;i gives Drishti to the 3 Movable R&#257;&#347;is,
barring the adjacent Movable R&#257;&#347;i. And a Common
R&#257;&#347;i gives a Drishti to the other three Common
R&#257;&#347;is. The Grah in a R&#257;&#347;i gives the same
Drishti, as the R&#257;&#347;i (in which the Grah is) does.</p>

<p>4-5. Dristhis of the Grahas. A Grah in a Movable
R&#257;&#347;i gives a Drishti to the other 3 Fixed
R&#257;&#347;is, leaving the Fixed R&#257;&#347;i next to it. A
Grah in a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i does not give a Drishti to the
next Movable R&#257;&#347;i, but the remaining 3 Movable
R&#257;&#347;is. The one in a Common R&#257;&#347;i gives a
Drishti to the remaining 3 Common R&#257;&#347;is.
Simultaneously a Grah in the R&#257;&#347;i, that receives a
Drishti, is also subjected to the Drishti concerned.</p>

<p>6-9. Diagram of Dristhis. As depicted by Lord Brahma, I now
narrate the diagram of Drishtis, so that Drishtis are easily
understood by a mere sight of the diagram. Draw a square, or a
circle marking the 8 directions (4 corners and 4 quarters
thereof). Mark the zodiacal R&#257;&#347;is, as under: Mesh and
Vrishabh in East, Mithun in the North-East, Kark and Simh in the
North, Kanya in the North-West, Tula and Vrischik in the West,
Dhanu in the South-West, Makar and Kumbh in the South and Meen
in the South-East.</p>

<p>Addition Santhanam till Ch. 9. The Drishtis (as per the
earlier Slokas) can be shown in a square diagram, or circular
diagram (as per convenience).</p>

<h2><a name=9>Ch. 9. Evils at Birth</a></h2>

<p>1. O Brahmin, first of all estimate the evils and checking
factors thereof through Lagn and then declare the effects of the
12 Bhavas.</p>

<p>2. Evils, causing premature end, exist up to the
24<sup>th</sup> year of one’s age. As such, no definite
calculation of life span should be made till such year of
age.</p>

<p>3-6. Short-life Combinations (up to Sloka 23). Should Candr
be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava and receives a Drishti from a
malefic, the child will die soon. If in the process there be a
Drishti from a benefic, it may live up to 8. If a benefic is
retrograde in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, receiving a Drishti
from a malefic, death will occur within a month of birth. This
is true, only when Lagn is not occupied by a benefic. Should
Putr Bhava be occupied by &#346;ani, Mangal and S&#363;rya
jointly, (early) death of mother and brother will come to pass.
Mangal, placed in Tanu, or in Randhr Bhava and be yuti with
&#346;ani, or S&#363;rya, or receiving a Drishti from a malefic,
being bereft of a Drishti from a benefic, will prove a source of
(immediate) death.</p>

<p>7-11. If &#346;ani and Mangal give a Drishti to Lagn, as the
luminaries are yuti with Rahu (elsewhere), the child will live a
fortnight. Immediate death of the child along with its mother
will occur, if &#346;ani is in Karm Bhava, Candr in Ari Bhava
and Mangal in Yuvati Bhava. One will immediately go to the abode
of Yama, if &#346;ani is in Tanu Bhava, while Candr and Guru are
in their order in Randhr and Sahaj Bhava. Only a month will be
the span of one’s life, who had S&#363;rya in Dharm Bhava,
Mangal in Yuvati Bhava and Guru and &#346;ukr in Labh Bhava. All
Grahas (any Grah) in Vyaya Bhava will be the source of a short
life, specifically the luminaries, &#346;ukr and Rahu. But the
Drishti of these four Grahas (on Vyaya Bhava) will counteract
such evils.</p>

<p>12. Candr is capable of causing early end, if she is with a
malefic in Yuvati, Randhr, or Tanu Bhava and unrelated to a
benefic.</p>

<p>13. Early death will come to pass, if there be a birth in the
morning, or evening junctions, or in a Hora, ruled by Candr, or
in Gandanta, while Candr and malefics occupy Kendras from
Lagn.</p>

<p>14. Definition of Sandhya. 3 Ghatis before the sight of the
semi disc (half) of the rising S&#363;rya and a similar
duration, following S&#363;rya’s set, are called, as morning
twilight and evening twilight, respectively.</p>

<p>15. Early Death.  Should all the malefics be in the oriental
half, while benefics are in the occidental half, early death of
one born in Vrischik, will follow. In this case there is no need
of any rethinking.</p>

<p>16. Malefic in Vyaya and Ari Bhava, or in Randhr and Dhan
Bhava, while Lagn is hemmed between other malefics, will bring
early death.</p>

<p>17. Malefics, occupying Tanu and Yuvati Bhava, while Candr is
yuti with a malefic with no relief from a benefic, will also
cause premature death.</p>

<p>18. Early death will be inflicted on the native, if
decreasing Candr is in Tanu Bhava, while malefics capture Randhr
Bhava and a Kendra. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>19. Candr in Tanu, Randhr, Vyaya, or Yuvati Bhava and hemmed
between malefics will confer premature death.</p>

<p>20. Should Candr be in Tanu Bhava, hemmed between malefics,
while Yuvati, or Randhr Bhava has a malefic in it, he will face
immediate death along with his mother.</p>

<p>21. Should &#346;ani, S&#363;rya and Mangal be in Vyaya,
Dharm and Randhr Bhava without Drishti from a benefic, the child
will face instant death.</p>

<p>22. With a malefic in Yuvati Bhava, or in the rising
Dreshkan, while decreasing Candr is in Tanu Bhava, death be
experienced early.</p>

<p>23. The life span of the child will be either 2 months, or 6
months only, if all Grahas devoid of strength are relegated to
Apoklima Bhavas.</p>

<p>24. Evils to Mother (up to Sloka 33). The mother of the
native will incur evils (will die soon), if Candr at birth
receives a Drishti from three malefics. Benefics, giving a
Drishti to Candr, will bring good to the mother.</p>

<p>25. Should Dhan Bhava be occupied by Rahu, Budh, &#346;ukr,
S&#363;rya and &#346;ani, the child’s birth has been after its
father’s death, while even the mother will face early death.</p>

<p>26. If Candr is in the 7<sup>th</sup>, or the 8<sup>th</sup>
from a malefic, be herself with a malefic and receives a Drishti
from a strong malefic, predict mothers end to be early.</p>

<p>27. The child will not live on mother’s milk, but on that of
she-goat, if S&#363;rya is exalted, or debilitated in Yuvati
Bhava.</p>

<p>28. Should a malefic be in the 4<sup>th</sup>, identical with
an inimical R&#257;&#347;i, counted from Candr, while there is
no benefic in a Kendra, the child will lose its mother in a
premature manner.</p>

<p>29. Malefics in Ari and Vyaya Bhava will bring evils to
mother. The child’s father will receive similar effects, if
Bandhu and Karm Bhava are captured by malefics.</p>

<p>30. Budh in Dhan Bhava, while malefics occupy Tanu and Vyaya
Bhava: this Yoga will destroy the entire family.</p>

<p>31. Guru, &#346;ani and Rahu, respectively, posited in Tanu,
Dhan and Sahaj Bhava will cause mother’s death early.</p>

<p>32. Doubtlessly the mother will give up the child, if it has
malefics in Konas, counted from the decreasing Candr. No benefic
shall be yuti with the said malefics.</p>

<p>33. If Mangal and &#346;ani are together in a Kendra with
reference to Candr and occupy one and the same
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the child will have two mothers.  Yet it
will be short-lived.</p>

<p>34. Evil to Father (up to Sloka 42). One’s father will incur
early death, if &#346;ani, Mangal and Candr in their orders are
in Tanu, Yuvati and Ari Bhava.</p>

<p>35. The native will at the time of his marriage lose his
father, if Guru is in Tanu Bhava, while &#346;ani, S&#363;rya,
Mangal and Budh are together in Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>36. Early loss of father will take place, if S&#363;rya is
with a malefic, or is hemmed between malefics, as there is
another malefic in the 7<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>37. Remote will be the possibility of one’s father
sustaining, if S&#363;rya is in Yuvati, while Mangal is in Karm
and Rahu is in Vyaya Bhava.</p>

<p>38. Early and troubled will be one’s father’s death, if
Mangal is in Karm Bhava identical with his enemy’s
R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>39. Candr in Ari Bhava, &#346;ani in Tanu Bhava and Mangal in
Yuvati Bhava: this array of heavenly bodies at birth will not
ensure a long span of life for the father.</p>

<p>40. If S&#363;rya receives a Drishti from &#346;ani and be in
Mesh, or in Vrischik Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the father would
have given up the family before birth of the child, or would
have passed away.</p>

<p>41. If Bandhu, Karm and Vyaya Bhava are all occupied by
malefics, both the parents will leave the child to its own fate
and wander from place to place.</p>

<p>42. The father will not see the native till his (the
native’s) 23<sup>rd</sup> year, if Rahu and Guru are together in
an inimical R&#257;&#347;i identical with Tanu, or Bandhu
Bhava.</p>

<p>43-45. Parents.  S&#363;rya is the indicator of father for
all beings, while the mother is indicated by Candr. Should
S&#363;rya receive a Drishti from one, or more malefics, or be
hemmed between them, this will cause evils to father. Similarly
Candr be considered in respect of mother. Malefics in the
6<sup>th</sup>, the 8<sup>th</sup>, or the 4<sup>th</sup> from
S&#363;rya will bring inauspicious results about the father.
Malefics in such places from Candr will be adverse for the
mother. The strength, or otherwise of the occupants concerned be
suitably estimated.</p>

<h2><a name=10>Ch. 10. Antidotes for Evils</a></h2>

<p>1. Those are the evils (due to a native). I now narrate the
antidotes for such evils as well, which will be helpful to
assess the extent of inauspiciousness.</p>

<p>2. Should one among Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr be in an angle
from Lagn, all evils are destroyed, as S&#363;rya eliminates
darkness.</p>

<p>3. Just as a single reverential obeisance before Lord Shiva,
the Trident holder frees one from all sins, a single, but strong
Guru in Lagn will ward off all the evils.</p>

<p>4. Lagn Lord is singly capable of counteracting all evils, if
he is strongly placed in an angle, just as Lord Shiva, the
holder of the Bow destroyed the three cities, built of gold,
silver and iron for the demons by Maya.</p>

<p>5. All evils are destroyed, if a benefic drishties Lagn of
one born during the night in the bright half. Similarly a
malefic’s Drishti on Lagn of one born during day time in the
dark half.</p>

<p>6. S&#363;rya in Vyaya will confer a hundred-year life span
on one born in Tul Lagn.</p>

<p>7. It will prove auspicious for the mother as well as the
native, if Mangal joins, or is drishtied by Guru.</p>

<p>8. If malefics are surrounded by benefics, while angles, or
trines are themselves benefic-occupied, evils disappear soon.
Not only this, evils will not follow from the Bhavas
concerned.</p>

<h2><a name=11>Ch. 11. Judgement of Bhavas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Maharishi Parashar, I have come to know of the evils and
antidotes thereof from you.  Please tell me, what is to be
deduced from each Bhava.</p>

<p>2. Indications of Tanu Bhava. Maharishi Parashar replies.
Physique, appearance, intellect (or the organ of intelligence,
i.e. brain), complexion of the body, vigour, weakness,
happiness, grief and innate nature are all to be guessed through
the ascending R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>3. Indications of Dhan Bhava. Wealth, grains (food etc.),
family, death, enemies, metals, precious stones etc. are to be
understood through Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>4. Indications of Sahaj Bhava. From Sahaj Bhava know of the
following: valour, servants (attending etc.), brothers, sisters
etc., initiatory instructions (Upadesh), journey and parent’s
death.</p>

<p>5. Indications of Bandhu Bhava. Conveyances, relatives,
mother, happiness, treasure, lands and buildings are to be
consulted through Bandhu Bhava.</p>

<p>6. Indications of Putr Bhava. The learned should deduce from
Putr Bhava amulets, sacred spells, learning, knowledge, sons,
royalty (or authority), fall of position etc.</p>

<p>7. Indications of Ari Bhava. Maternal uncle, doubts about
death, enemies, ulcers, step-mother etc. are to be estimated
from Ari Bhava.</p>

<p>8. Indications of Yuvati Bhava. Wife, travel, trade, loss of
sight, death etc. be known from Yuvati Bhava.</p>

<p>9. Indications of Randhr Bhava. Randhr Bhava indicates
longevity, battle, enemies, forts, wealth of the dead and
things, that have happened and are to happen (in the past and
future births).</p>

<p>10. Indications of Dharm Bhava. Fortunes, wife’s brother,
religion, brother’s wife, visits to shrines etc. be known from
Dharm Bhava.</p>

<p>11. Indications of Karm Bhava. Royalty (authority), place,
profession (livelihood), honour, father, living in foreign lands
and debts are to be understood from Karm Bhava.</p>

<p>12. Indications of Labh Bhava. All articles, son’s wife,
income, prosperity, quadrupeds etc.  are to be understood from
Labh Bhava.</p>

<p>13. Indications of Vyaya Bhava. From Vyaya Bhava, one can
know about expenses, history of enemies, one’s own death
etc.</p>

<p>14-16.  Prosperity, or Annihilation of a Bhava. Predict
prosperity of the Bhava, which is yuti with, or drishtied by a
benefic. Also, when its Lord is in Yuvavastha, or
Prabuddhavastha, or in Kismaravastha, or in Karm Bhava, the
Bhavas well-being is indicated. The Bhava, which is not
drishtied by its Lord, or, whose Lord is with a malefic Grah, or
with one of the Lords of evil and such other Bhavas (i.e.
3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>
and 12<sup>th</sup>), or is defeated in a war between Grahas, or
is in one of the three Avasthas, viz, Vriddhavastha, Mritavastha
and Suptavastha.</p>

<h2><a name=12>Ch. 12. Effects of Tanu Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Physical comforts. Should Lagn Lord be yuti with a
malefic, or be in Randhr, 6<sup>th</sup>, or 12<sup>th</sup>,
physical felicity will diminish. If he is in an angle, or trine
there will be at all times comforts of the body. If Lagn Lord is
in debilitation, combustion, or enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, there
will be diseases.  With a benefic in an angle, or trine all
diseases will disappear. Lagn’s angles (i.e. Bandhu, Yuvati, or
the 10<sup>th</sup>), or its trine (Putr, Dharm), containing a
benefic, is a powerful remedy for all, related to health.</p>

<p>3. There will not be bodily health, if Lagn, or Candr be
drishtied by, or yuti with a malefic, being devoid of a benefics
Drishti.</p>

<p>4. Bodily Beauty.  A benefic in Lagn will give a pleasing
appearance, while a malefic will make one bereft of good
appearance. Felicity of the body will be enjoyed, if Lagn is
drishtied by, or yuti with a benefic.</p>

<p>5-7. Other Benefits. If Lagn Lord, Budh, Guru, or &#346;ukr
be in an angle, or in a trine, the native will be long lived,
wealthy, intelligent and liked by the king.  Fame, wealth,
abundant pleasures and comforts of the body will be acquired, if
Lagn Lord is in a Movable R&#257;&#347;i and be drishtied by a
benefic Grah.  One will be endowed with royal marks (of
fortune), if Budh, Guru, or &#346;ukr be in Lagn along with the
Candr, or be in angle from Lagn. If Budh, Guru, or &#346;ukr be
in 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, or 10<sup>th</sup> from Lagn,
or be in the company of Candr in Lagn, the native will enjoy
royal fortunes.</p>

<p>8. Coiled Birth.  If there be a birth in one of Mesh,
Vrishabh and Simh Lagnas, containing either &#346;ani, or
Mangal, the birth of the child is with a coil around a limb. The
corresponding limb will be in accordance with the
R&#257;&#347;i, or Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, rising.</p>

<p>9. Birth of Twins. The native, who has S&#363;rya in a
quadruped R&#257;&#347;i, while others are in Dual
R&#257;&#347;is with strength, is born, as one of the twins.</p>

<p>10. To Be Nurtured by Three Mothers. If S&#363;rya and Candr
join in one and the same Bhava and fall in one
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be nurtured by three
different mothers for the first three months from its birth and
will later on be brought up by its father and brother.
(‘Bhratri’ apart from meaning a brother calls for
interpretation, as a near relative in general)</p>

<p>11. Important.  The learned in Jyotish should base the
effects on Candr also, as are applicable to Lagn. Now explained
are clues to know of ulcers, identity marks etc. on one’s
person.</p>

<p>12-14. Decanates and Bodily Limbs. Head, eyes, ears, nose,
temple, chin and face is the order of limbs, denoted (by the
various Bhavas), when the first decanate of a R&#257;&#347;i
ascends. In the case of the second decanate ascending the order
is neck, shoulder, arm, side, heart, stomach and navel. The
order for the third decanate ascending is pelvis, anus/penis,
testicles, thigh, knee, calf and foot. The portion already risen
indicates left side of the body (while the one yet to rise, i.e.
the invisible half, denotes the right side of the body).</p>

<p>15. Limbs Affected. The limb, related to a malefic by
occupation, will have ulcers, or scars, while the one, related
to a benefic, will have a mark (like moles etc).  So say the
Jyotishis. (Also see Sloka 6, Ch. 4 of Saravali, which states,
that a malefic, or a benefic, if be in own R&#257;&#347;i, or
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the effects will be right from birth. In
other cases it will be in the course of one’s life, that these
effects will come to pass)</p>

<h2><a name=13>Ch. 13. Effects of Dhan Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Combinations for Wealth. O excellent of the Brahmins,
listen to me, speaking on the effects of Dhan Bhava. If the Lord
of Dhan is in Dhan, or is in an angle, or in trine, he will
promote one’s wealth (or monetary state). Should he be in
Ari/8<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup>, financial conditions will
decline. A benefic in Dhan will give wealth, while a malefic
instead will destroy wealth.</p>

<p>3. One will be wealthy, if Guru is in Dhan, as the Lord of
Dhan, or is with Mangal.</p>

<p>4. If Dhan Lord is in Labh, while the Lord of Labh in Dhan,
wealth will be acquired by the native. Alternately these two
Lords may join in an angle, or in a trine.</p>

<p>5. If the Lord of Dhan is in an angle, while Labh Lord is in
a trine thereof, or is drishtied by, or yuti with Guru and
&#346;ukr, the subject will be wealthy.</p>

<p>6-7. Yogas for Poverty. One will be penniless, if the Lord of
Dhan Bhava is in an evil Bhava, while the Lord of Labh Bhava is
also so placed and Dhan Bhava is occupied by a malefic. There
will be penury right from birth and the native will have to beg
even for his food, if the Lords of Dhan and Labh Bhava are both
combust, or with malefics.</p>

<p>8. Loss of Wealth through the King. Should the Lords of Dhan
and Labh Bhava be relegated to Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava,
while Mangal is in Labh Bhava and Rahu is in Dhan Bhava, the
native will lose his wealth on account of royal punishments.</p>

<p>9. Expenses on Good Accounts. When Guru is in Labh, &#346;ukr
is in Dhan and a benefic is placed in Vyaya Bhava, while Dhan’s
Lord is yuti with a benefic, there will be expenses on
religious, or charitable grounds.</p>

<p>10. Fame etc. If Dhan’s Lord is in own R&#257;&#347;i, or is
exalted, the native will look after his people, will help others
and also will become famous.</p>

<p>11. Effortless Aquisition. If Dhan’s Lord is yuti with a
benefic and is in a good division, like
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, there will be effortlessly all kinds
of wealth in the native’s family.
(“Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;dau” of the text denotes Paravat, or
such other higher Vargas: Dhan’s Lord should be in
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Brahmalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, Sakravahan&#257;&#324;&#347;, or
Sridham&#257;&#324;&#347; in the Dash Varg scheme)</p>

<p>12. Eyes. If Dhan Lord is endowed with strength, the native
will possess beautiful eyes. Should the said Grah be in Ari,
Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be disease, or deformity of
eyes.</p>

<p>13. Untruthful Person. If Dhan Bhava and its Lord are yuti
with malefics, the native will be a talebearer, will speak
untruth and will be afflicted by windy diseases.</p>

<h2><a name=14>Ch. 14. Effects of Sahaj Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. O Brahmin, I now tell you about Sahaj Bhava. Should Sahaj
Bhava be yuti with, or drishtied by a benefic, the native will
be endowed with co-born and be courageous.</p>

<p>2. If Sahaj’s Lord along with Mangal drishties Sahaj Bhava,
the native will enjoy good results, due to Sahaj Bhava.
Alternatively these two Grahas may be in Sahaj itself.</p>

<p>3. Destruction at once of co-born will come to pass, if the
said 2 Grahas are together with a malefic, or in a
R&#257;&#347;i, owned by a malefic.</p>

<p>4-4&frac12;.  Female and Male Co-born. If Sahaj’s Lord is a
female Grah, or, if Sahaj Bhava be occupied by female Grahas,
one will have sisters, born after him. Similarly male Grahas and
male R&#257;&#347;is denote younger brothers. Should it be of
mixed nature, co-born of both sexes will be obtained. These
effects be declared after assessing the strength and weakness of
the concerned.</p>

<p>5-6. Should Sahaj’s Lord and Mangal be together in Randhr
Bhava, destruction of co-born will result. Happiness in this
respect will come to pass, if Mangal, or Sahaj’s Lord is in an
angle, or in a trine, or in exaltation, or friendly
divisions.</p>

<p>7-11. Number of Brothers and Sisters. If Budh is in Sahaj
Bhava, while Sahaj’s Lord and Candr are together, as the
indicator (Mangal) joins &#346;ani, the effects are:  there
occurred the birth of an elder sister and there will be younger
brothers.  Furthermore, the third brother will die. Should
Mangal be yuti with Rahu, while Sahaj’s Lord is in his
debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, there will be loss of younger
brothers and/or sisters, while three elder brothers and/or
sisters were attained by the native. If Sahaj’s Lord is in an
angle, while the significator (Mangal) is exalted in a trine and
be yuti with Guru, 12 will be the number of total co-born. Out
of these two elders and the 3<sup>rd</sup>, the 7<sup>th</sup>,
the 9<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> of the younger
co-born will be shortlived, while six of the said twelve will be
longlived.</p>

<p>12-13. There will be 1 co-born, if Vyaya’s Lord (some texts
read, as Labh’s Lord) joins Mangal and Guru, while Sahaj Bhava
is occupied by Candr. If Candr is lonely placed in Sahaj Bhava
with Drishti of male Grahas, there will be younger brothers,
while the Drishti of &#346;ukr denotes younger sisters.</p>

<p>14. Adverse Grahas. S&#363;rya in Sahaj Bhava will destroy
the preborn. The afterborn will be destroyed, if &#346;ani is
found in Sahaj Bhava. In the same situation Mangal will destroy
both the preborn and later-born.</p>

<p>15. After estimating the strength and weakness of such Yogas,
the effects, related to brothers and sisters, be announced.</p>

<h2><a name=15>Ch. 15. Effects of Bandhu Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have been briefly told
the effects of Sahaj Bhava. Now listen to the results, related
to Bandhu Bhava.</p>

<p>2. Housing Comforts. One will have residential comforts in
full degree, if Bandhu is occupied by its Lord, or by Lagn’s
Lord and be drishtied by a benefic.</p>

<p>3. Miscellaneous.  Should Putr’s Lord be in his own Bhava, or
in own Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in exaltation, the native will
be endowed with comforts, related to lands, conveyances, houses
etc. and musical instruments.</p>

<p>4. Housing Comforts. If Karm’s Lord joins Bandhu’s Lord in an
angle, or in a trine, the native will acquire beautiful
mansions.</p>

<p>5. Relatives.  Should Budh be in Lagn, while Bandhu’s Lord,
being a benefic, is drishtied by another benefic, the native
will be honoured by his relatives.</p>

<p>6. Long-living Mother. If Bandhu Bhava is occupied by a
benefic, while its Lord is in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, as
the indicator of mother is endowed with strength, the native
will have a long-living mother.</p>

<p>7. Happiness of Mother. The native’s mother will be happy, if
Bandhu’s Lord is in an angle, while &#346;ukr is also in an
angle, as Budh is exalted.</p>

<p>8. Quadrupeds.  S&#363;rya in Bandhu, Candr and &#346;ani in
Dharm and Mangal in Labh Bhava; this Yoga will confer cows and
buffaloes on the native.</p>

<p>9. Dumbness.  Should Bandhu Bhava be a Movable one, while its
Lord and Mangal are together in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native
will be dumb.</p>

<p>10-14.  Conveyances. If Lagn’s Lord is a benefic, while
Bandhu’s Lord is in fall, or in Labh Bhava and the significator
(&#346;ukr) is in Vyaya Bhava, the native will obtain
conveyances in his 12<sup>th</sup> year. Should S&#363;rya be in
Bandhu Bhava, as Bandhu’s Lord is exalted and be with &#346;ukr,
one will acquire conveyances in his 32<sup>nd</sup> year. It
will be in the 42<sup>nd</sup> year, that one will be endowed
with conveyances, if Bandhu’s Lord joins Karm’s Lord in his
(4<sup>th</sup> Lord’s) exaltation Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;. An
exchange between Labh’s and Bandhu’s Lords will confer
conveyances in the 12<sup>th</sup> year. A benefic, related to
Bandhu Bhava (and to its Lord), will bring with him auspicious
effects (regarding conveyances), while a malefic will produce
only malefic effects (in respect of conveyances). Should a
benefic be in Bandhu, drishti Bandhu, or in yuti with the Lord
of Bandhu, or a Drishti on the Lord of Bandhu Bhava, then the
native will be happy with conveyances and be free from accidents
and dangers. A malefic, replacing the said benefic, will cause
losses, concerning vehicles and reduce one to severe
accidents.</p>

<h2><a name=16>Ch. 16. Effects of Putr Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1-3. O Brahmin, now I tell you the effects, related to Putr
Bhava. If the Lords of Lagn and Putr are in their own
R&#257;&#347;is, or in an angle, or in a trine, one will enjoy
thorough happiness through his children. Should Putr’s Lord be
in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be no offspring.
Should the Lord of Putr be combust, or be with malefics and be
weak, there will be no children; even, if per chance issues are
obtained, they will only quit the world soon. The Yuti of Putr’s
Lord with Lagn’s Lord in a good Bhava will ensure early
obtainment of children apart from happiness through them. If
they join in an evil Bhava, they will prove a defect in this
respect.</p>

<p>4. If Putr’s Lord is in Ari Bhava, as Lagn’s Lord is yuti
with Mangal, the native will lose his very first child,
whereafter his female will not be fertile to yield an
offspring.</p>

<p>5. Should Putr’s Lord be in fall in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya
Bhava, while Budh and Ketu are in Putr Bhava, the native’s wife
will give birth to one child only.</p>

<p>6. If Putr’s Lord is in fall and be not in Drishti to Putr,
while &#346;ani and Budh are in Putr, the native’s wife will
give birth to one child only.</p>

<p>7. Should Dharm’s Lord be in Lagn, while Putr’s Lord is in
fall and Ketu is in Putr along with Budh, obtainment of progeny
will be after a great deal of ordeal.</p>

<p>8. If Putr’s Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or be in
an inimical R&#257;&#347;i, or be in fall, or in Putr itself,
the native will beget issues with difficulty.</p>

<p>9. Should Putr Bhava be owned by &#346;ani, or Budh and be
occupied, or drishtied by &#346;ani and Mandi, one will have
adopted issues.</p>

<p>10. Should S&#363;rya and Candr be together in a
R&#257;&#347;i and in the same Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native
will be brought up by three mothers, or two fathers.</p>

<p>11. Adopted issue is indicated, if Putr is tenanted by six
Grahas, while its Lord is in Vyaya Bhava and Candr and Lagn are
endowed with strength.</p>

<p>12. There will be many children, if Putr’s Lord is strong,
while Putr is drishtied by strong Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr.</p>

<p>13. If Putr’s Lord is with Candr, or is in her Decanate, the
native will beget daughters; so say Jyotishis.</p>

<p>14. If Putr’s Lord is in a Movable R&#257;&#347;i, while
&#346;ani is in Putr, as Rahu is with Candr, the child (so born)
is of questionable birth.</p>

<p>15. Undoubtedly the native is born of other’s loins, if Candr
is in the 8<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, while Guru is in the
8<sup>th</sup> from Candr. Malefic’s Drishti, or Yuti is
essential in this Yog.</p>

<p>16. If Putr’s Lord is exalted, or be in Dhan, Putr, or Dharm
Bhava, or be yuti with, or drishtied by Guru, obtainment of
children will be there.</p>

<p>17. One will obtain children, that will indulge in mean
deeds, if Putr is occupied by three, or four malefics, while
Putr’s Lord is in fall. A benefic (including Budh) in Putr is
excluded in the said combination.</p>

<p>18. If Putr is occupied by Guru, while its Lord is with
&#346;ukr, one will obtain an offspring in his 32<sup>nd</sup>,
or 33<sup>rd</sup> year.</p>

<p>19. Should Putr’s Lord be in an angle along with Guru, the
Karak, one will beget a child at the age of 30, or 36.</p>

<p>20. If Guru is in Dharm Bhava, while &#346;ukr is in the
9<sup>th</sup> from Guru along with Lagn’s Lord, one will beget
a child at the age of 40.</p>

<p>21. The native will at the age of 32 lose his child, if Rahu
is in Putr, Putr’s Lord is in Yuti with a malefic and Guru is in
debilitation.</p>

<p>22. There will be loss of children at 33 and 36, if a malefic
is in the 5<sup>th</sup> from Guru, while another is in the
5<sup>th</sup> from Lagn.</p>

<p>23. Should Mandi be in Lagn, while Lagn’s Lord is in fall,
grief on account of loss of child at the age of 56 will come to
pass.</p>

<p>24-32. Number of Children. There will be 10 sons, if Bandhu
Bhava and Ari Bhava are occupied by malefics, while Putr’s Lord
is in deep exaltation, joining Lagn’s Lord, as Guru is with
another benefic. Nine will be the number of sons, that one will
beget, if Guru is in deep exaltation, as Rahu is with Dhan’s
Lord and Dharm is occupied by its own Lord. There will be eight
sons, if Guru is in Putr, or Dharm Bhava, while Putr’s Lord is
endowed with strength and Dhan’s Lord is in Karm Bhava.
&#346;ani in Dharm Bhava, while Putr’s Lord is in Putr itself,
gives 7 sons, out of which twins will be born twice. If Putr’s
Lord is in Putr in Yuti with Dhan’s Lord, there will be birth of
7 sons, out of which 3 will pass away. Only one son is denoted,
if there be a malefic in Putr Bhava, while Guru is in the
5<sup>th</sup> from &#346;ani, or vice versa. If Putr Bhava has
a malefic in it, or, if &#346;ani is in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Guru, the native will beget offspring only through his second,
or third wife. Should Putr be occupied by a malefic, while Guru
is yuti with &#346;ani in Putr Bhava, as Lagn’s Lord is in Dhan
Bhava and Putr’s Lord is yuti with Mangal, one will live long,
but lose his children one after the other, as they are born.</p>

<h2><a name=17>Ch. 17. Effects of Ari Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. O Brahmin, following are the effects, produced by Ari
Bhava, relating to diseases, ulcers etc. Listen to this
attentively.</p>

<p>2.  Ulcers/Bruises. Should Ari’s Lord be in Ari itself, or in
Lagn, or Randhr, there will be ulcers, or bruises on the body.
The R&#257;&#347;i, becoming Ari Bhava, will lead to the
knowledge of the concerned limb.</p>

<p>3-5. Relatives Affected. The Karak of a relative, or the Lord
of such a Bhava, joining Ari’s Lord, or being in Ari, or Randhr
Bhava, indicates ulcers/bruises to such a relative, like father.
S&#363;rya with such lordship and in such a Bhava denotes such
affectation of head, Candr of the face, Mangal of the neck, Budh
of the navel, Guru of the nose, &#346;ukr of the eyes, &#346;ani
of the feet and the Rahu and Ketu of the abdomen.</p>

<p>6. Facial Diseases. Should Lagn’s Lord be in a R&#257;&#347;i
of Mangal, or of Budh and has a Drishti on Budh, there will be
diseases of the face.</p>

<p>7-8&frac12;.  Leprosy. Mangal, or Budh, having ownership of
the ascending R&#257;&#347;i and joining Candr, Rahu and
&#346;ani, will cause leprosy. If Candr is in Lagn, which is not
however Cancer, and be with Rahu, there will occur white
leprosy. &#346;ani in place of Rahu will cause black leprosy,
while Mangal similarly will afflict one with blood-leprosy.</p>

<p>9-12&frac12;.  Diseases in General. When Lagn is occupied by
the Lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava along with S&#363;rya, the
native will be afflicted by fever and tumours.  Mangal,
replacing S&#363;rya, will cause swelling and hardening of the
blood vessels and wounds and hits by weapons. Budh so featuring
will bring in billious diseases, while Guru in similar case will
destroy any disease. Similarly &#346;ukr will cause diseases
through females, &#346;ani windy diseases, Rahu danger through
low-caste-men and Ketu navel diseases. Candr in Yuti with the
Lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava will inflict dangers through water
and phlegmatic disorders. Similar estimates be made from the
respective significators and Bhavas for relatives, like
father.</p>

<p>13-19&frac12; TIMING OF ILLNESS. The native will be afflicted
by illness throughout life, if &#346;ani is with Rahu, while Ari
Lord and 6<sup>th</sup> Bhava are yuti with malefics. One will
suffer from (severe) fever at the age of 6 and at the age of 12,
if Mangal is in Ari, while Ari Lord is in Randhr. If the Candr
is in Dhanu/Meen, while Guru is in Ari from Lagn, one will
suffer from leprosy at the age of 19 and 22. If Rahu is in Ari,
Lagna Lord is in Randhr and Mandi is in an angle, consumption
will trouble the native at the age of 26. Spleenary disorders
will be experienced at the age of 29 and 30, if the Lords of
6<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> are in exchange of their
R&#257;&#347;is. &#346;ani and Candr together in Ari will
inflict blood-leprosy at the age of 45. If &#346;ani is with an
inimical planet, while Lagn Lord is in Lagn itself, windy
disorders (like rheumatism) will trouble the native at the age
of 59.</p>

<p>20-22.  UNFORTUNATE YEARS. Should Candr be yuti with Ari
Lord, while the 8<sup>th</sup> Lord is in Ari and the
12<sup>th</sup> Lord is in Lagn, the native will be troubled by
animals at the age of eight. O Brahmin, if Rahu is in Ari, while
&#346;ani is in Randhr from the said Rahu, the child will have
danger through fire at the age of 1 and 2, while in Sahaj year
birds will bring some evils.</p>

<p>23-25.  UNFORTUNATE YEARS (continued). Danger through water
will have to be feared during Putr and Dharm years, if
S&#363;rya is in Ari, or Randhr, while Candr is in Vyaya from
the said S&#363;rya. &#346;ani in Randhr, as Mangal is in
Yuvati, all cause small-pox in Karm year and in 30<sup>th</sup>
year of age. If 8<sup>th</sup> Lord joins Rahu in an angle/trine
from Randhr Bhava and be in Randhr in Navamsa, the subject will
be troubled by swelling of blood vessels, urinary disorders etc.
during the 18<sup>th</sup> year and the 22<sup>nd</sup>
year.</p>

<p>26. LOSS THROUGH ENEMIES. Loss of wealth will come to pass
during the 31<sup>st</sup> year, if Labh and 6<sup>th</sup>
Lords exchange their R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>27. INIMICAL SONS. One’s own sons will be his enemies, if
Putr Lord is in Ari, while Ari Lord is with Guru. Simultaneously
Vyaya Lord should be in Lagn.</p>

<p>28. FEAR FROM DOGS. There will be fear from dogs during the
10<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> year, if the Lagna Lord and
the 6<sup>th</sup> Lord are in exchange.</p>

<h2><a name=18>Ch. 18. Effects of Yuvati Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me, detailing the
effects of the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava.  If Yuvati Lord is in his
own R&#257;&#347;i, or in exaltation, one will derive full
happiness through his wife (and marriage).</p>

<p>2. SICK WIFE.  Should Yuvati Lord be in Ari, 8<sup>th</sup>,
or Vyaya, the wife will be sickly. This however does not apply
to own Bhava, or exaltation placement, as above.</p>

<p>3. Excessive·Libidinousness/Death·of·Wife.  If &#346;ukr is
in Yuvati, the native will be exceedingly libidinous. If
&#346;ukr yuti a malefic in any Bhava, it will cause loss of
wife.</p>

<p>4-5. THE 7<sup>TH</sup> LORD. Should Yuvati Lord be endowed
with strength and be yuti with, or be drishtied by a benefic,
the native will be wealthy, honourable, happy and fortunate.
Conversely, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, or is combust, or is in
an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, one will acquire sick wives and many
wives.</p>

<p>6. PLURALITY OF WIVES. If Yuvati Lord is in a R&#257;&#347;i
of &#346;ani, or of &#346;ukr and be drishtied by a benefic,
there will be many wives. Should Yuvati Lord be particularly in
exaltation, the same effects will come to pass.</p>

<p>7-8&frac12;.  MlSCELLANEOUS MATTERS. The native will befriend
barren females, if S&#363;rya is in Yuvati. Candr therein will
cause association with such female, as corresponding to the
R&#257;&#347;i, becoming Yuvati. Mangal, placed in Yuvati, will
denote association with marriageable girls (those with menses),
or with barren females. Budh indicates harlots, mean females and
females, belonging to traders’ community. Wife of a Brahmin, or
a pregnant female will be in the native’s association, if Guru
is in Yuvati. Base females and females, having attained their
courses, are denoted by &#346;ani, Rahu/Ketu in Yuvati.</p>

<p>8-9&frac12;. Mangal denotes a female with attractive breasts.
&#346;ani indicates sick and weak spouse. Guru will bring a
spouse with hard and prominent breasts. &#346;ukr will bring one
with bulky and excellent breasts.</p>

<p>10-13&frac12;.  Malefics in Vyaya and 7<sup>th</sup>, while
decreasing Candr is in Putr denote, that the native will be
controlled by spouse, who will be inimical to the race (or
family). If Yuvati Bhava is occupied, or owned by
&#346;ani/Mangal, the native will beget a harlot, as his spouse,
or he will be attached to other illegally.  Should &#346;ukr be
in a Navamsa of Mangal, or in a Rasi of Mangal, or receive a
Drishti from, or be yuti with Mangal, the native will “kiss” the
private parts of the female. If &#346;ukr is so related to
&#346;ani, the native will “kiss” the private parts of the
male.</p>

<p>14-15. WORTHY SPOUSE. The native will beget a spouse endowed
with (the seven principal) virtues, who will expand his dynasty
by sons and grandsons, if the 7<sup>th</sup> Lord is exalted,
while Yuvati is occupied by strong Lagna Lord and a benefic.</p>

<p>16. EVILS TO SPOUSE. If Yuvati Bhava, or its Lord is yuti
with a malefic the native’s wife will incur evils, especially,
if Yuvati Bhava, or its Lord is bereft of strength.</p>

<p>17. LOSS OF SPOUSE. If Yuvati Lord is devoid of strength and
is relegated to Ari, 8<sup>th</sup>, or Vyaya, or, if Yuvati
Lord is in fall, the native’s wife will be destroyed (i.e. she
will die early).</p>

<p>18. LACK OF CONJUGAL FELICITY. If Candr is in Yuvati, as
Yuvati Lord is in Vyaya and the Karaka (indicator &#346;ukr) is
bereft of strength, the native will not be endowed with marital
happiness.</p>

<p>19-21. PLURALlIY OF WIVES. One will have two wives, if Yuvati
Lord is in fall, or in a malefic R&#257;&#347;i along with a
malefic, while Yuvati Bhava, or the 7<sup>th</sup> Navamsa
belong to a eunuch planet. If Mangal and &#346;ukr are in
Yuvati, or, if &#346;ani is Yuvati, while the Lord of Lagn is in
Randhr, the native will have 3 wives. There will be many wives,
if &#346;ukr is in a Dual R&#257;&#347;i, while its Lord is in
exaltation, as Yuvati Lord is endowed with strength.</p>

<p>22. TIME OF MARRIAGE (upto Sloka 34). If Yuvati Lord is in a
benefic’s Bhava (or in Dharm, as Subha R&#257;&#347;i so means),
while &#346;ukr is exalted, or is in own R&#257;&#347;i, the
native will marry at the age of 5, or 9.</p>

<p>23. If S&#363;rya is in Yuvati, while his dispositor is yuti
with &#346;ukr, there will be marriage at 7<sup>th</sup>, or
11<sup>th</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>24. &#346;ukr in Dhan, while Yuvati Lord is in Labh will give
marriage at the age of 10, or 16.</p>

<p>25. Marriage will take place during the 11<sup>th</sup> year,
if &#346;ukr is in an angle from Lagn, while Lagn Lord is in
Makar, or Kumbh.</p>

<p>26. The native will marry at 12, or l9, if &#346;ukr is in an
angle from the Lagna, while &#346;ani is in Yuvati counted from
&#346;ukr.</p>

<p>27. Should &#346;ukr be in Yuvati from Candr, while &#346;ani
is in Yuvati from &#346;ukr, marriage will be in the
18<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>28. Marriage will be in the 15<sup>th</sup> year, if Dhan
Lord is in Labh, while Lagn Lord is in Karm.</p>

<p>29. An exchange between the Lords of Dhan and Labh will bring
marriage 13 years after birth.</p>

<p>30. Ones 22<sup>nd</sup>/27<sup>th</sup> year will confer
marriage, if &#346;ukr is in Yuvati from the 8<sup>th</sup>
Bhava (i.e. Dhan from Lagna), while his dispositor is yuti with
Mangal.</p>

<p>31. Should Yuvati Lord be in Vyaya, while the natal Lord is
in Yuvati in Navamsa, marriage will be in
23<sup>rd</sup>/26<sup>th</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>32. Either the 25<sup>th</sup> year, or the 33<sup>rd</sup>
year will bring marriage, if Randhr Lord is in Yuvati, as
&#346;ukr is in Navamsa Lagna.</p>

<p>33. Should &#346;ukr be in Dharm from Dharm (i.e. in Putr
Bhava), while Rahu is in one of the said Bhavas (i.e. in
Putr/Dharm), marriage will take place during 31<sup>st</sup>, or
33<sup>rd</sup> year.</p>

<p>34. The native will marry at 30, or 27, if &#346;ukr is in
Lagn, while the 7<sup>th</sup> Lord is in Yuvati itself.</p>

<p>35-39. TIMING OF WIFE’S DEATH. Loss of wife will occur in the
18<sup>th</sup> year, or 33<sup>rd</sup> year of age of the
native, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, while &#346;ukr is in Randhr.
One will lose his spouse in his 19<sup>th</sup> year, if Yuvati
Lord is in the 8<sup>th</sup>, while Vyaya Lord is in Yuvati.
The native’s wife will die within three days of marriage due to
snake bite, if the native has Rahu in Dhan and Mangal in Yuvati.
If &#346;ukr is in Randhr, while his dispositor is in a
R&#257;&#347;i of &#346;ani, death of wife will take place
during the native’s 12<sup>th</sup>, or 21<sup>st</sup> year of
age. Should the ascendat Lord be in his R&#257;&#347;i of
debilitation, as Dhan Lord is in Randhr, loss of wife will occur
in the 13<sup>th</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>40-41. THREE MARRIAGES. Should Candr be in Yuvati from
&#346;ukr, while Budh is in Yuvati from Candr and Randhr Lord is
in Putr (from the Lagna), there will be marriage in Karm year
followed by another in the 22<sup>nd</sup> year and yet another
in the 33<sup>rd</sup> year.</p>

<p>42. DEATH OF WlFE. lf Ari, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>
are in their order occupied by Mangal, Rahu and &#346;ani, the
native’s wife will not live (long).</p>

<h2><a name=19>Ch. 19. Effects of Randhr Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. Long Life. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me speak
on the effects of Randhr Bhava.  If Randhr’s Lord is in an
angle, long life is indicated.</p>

<p>2. Short Life.  Should Randhr’s Lord join Lagn’s Lord, or a
malefic and be in Randhr itself, the native will be short
lived.</p>

<p>3. &#346;ani and Karm’s Lord about Longevity. Similarly
consider &#346;ani and Karm’s Lord in the matter of longevity.
Karm’s Lord is in Randhr along with a malefic Grah and/or Lagn’s
Lord.</p>

<p>4-7. Long Life.  There will be long life, if Ari’s Lord is in
Vyaya, or, if Ari’s Lord is in Ari, as Vyaya’s Lord is in Vyaya,
or, if Ari’s Lord and Vyaya’s Lord are in Lagn and Randhr. If
the Lords of Putr, Randhr and Tanu Bhava are in own
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as, own R&#257;&#347;is, or in friendly
R&#257;&#347;is, the native will enjoy a long span of life.
Should the Lords of Lagn, Randhr and Karm Bhava and &#346;ani
are all disposed severally in an angle, in a trine, or in Labh
Bhava, the subject will live long. Like these, there are many
other Yogas, dealing with the issue of longevity. The strength
and weakness of the Grahas concerned be estimated in deciding
longevity.</p>

<p>8-13. Short Life.  One’s span of life will be between 20 and
32 years, if Lagn’s Lord is weak, while Randhr’s Lord is an
angle. The native will only be short-lived, if Randhr’s Lord is
in fall, while Randhr Bhava has a malefic in it and Tanu Bhava
is bereft of strength. Death will be instant at birth, if Randhr
Bhava, Randhr’s Lord and Vyaya Bhava are all conjunct malefics.
Malefics in angles and/or trines and benefics in Ari and/or
Randhr Bhava, while Tanu Bhava has in it Randhr’s Lord in fall:
this Yoga will cause immediate end. If Putr and Randhr Bhava and
Randhr’s Lord are all conjunct malefics, the life span will be
very brief. Within a month of birth, death will befall the
child, if Randhr’s Lord is in Randhr itself, while Candr is with
malefics and be bereft of beneficial Drishti.</p>

<p>14-15. Long Life (again). One will be long-lived, if Lagn’s
Lord is in exaltation, while Candr and Guru are, respectively,
in Labh and Randhr Bhava. If Lagn’s Lord is exceedingly strong
and receives a Drishti from a benefic, which is placed in an
angle, the person concerned will be wealthy, virtuous and
long-lived.</p>

<h2><a name=20>Ch. 20. Effects of Dharm Bhava</a></h2>

<p>(1) Combinations for Fortunes. O Brahmin, now listen to the
effects of Dharm Bhava. One will be fortunate (or affluent), if
Dharm’s Lord is in Dharm Bhava with strength.</p>

<p>(2) Should Guru be in Dharm Bhava, while Dharm’s Lord is in
an angle and Lagn’s Lord is endowed with strength, one will be
extremely fortunate.</p>

<p>3. Fortunate (Affluent) Father. If Dharm’s Lord is with
strength, as &#346;ukr is in Dharm, while Guru is in an angle
from Tanu Bhava, the native’s father is fortunate.</p>

<p>4. Indigent Father. If Dharm’s Lord is debilitated, while the
2<sup>nd</sup> and/or the 4<sup>th</sup> from Dharm Bhava is
occupied by Mangal, the native’s father is poor.</p>

<p>5. Long-living Father. Should Dharm’s Lord be in deep
exaltation, while &#346;ukr is in an angle from Tanu Bhava and
Guru is in the 9<sup>th</sup> from Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn,
the father of the native will enjoy a long span of life.</p>

<p>6. Royal Status for Father. If Dharm’s Lord is an angle and
receives a Drishti from Guru, the native’s father will be a king
endowed with conveyances, or be equal to a king.</p>

<p>7. Wealthy and Famous Father. Should Dharm’s Lord be in Karm
Bhava, while Karm’s Lord receives a Drishti from a benefic the
native’s father will be very rich and famous.</p>

<p>8-9. Virtuous and Devoted to Father. Should S&#363;rya be in
deep exaltation, as Dharm’s Lord is in Labh Bhava, the native
will be virtuous, dear to the king and devoted to father. If
S&#363;rya is in a trine from Lagna, while Dharm’s Lord is in
Yuvati in yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from Guru, the
native will be devoted to his father.</p>

<p>10. Fortunes etc. Acquisition of fortunes, conveyances and
fame will follow the 32<sup>nd</sup> year of age, if Dharm’s
Lord is in Dhan, while Dhan’s Lord is in Dharm.</p>

<p>11. Inimical to Father. There will be mutual enmity between
the father and the native, if Lagn’s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, but
with the Lord of Ari. Further, the native’s father will be of
contemptible disposition.</p>

<p>12. Begged Food. If Karm’s Lord and Sahaj’s Lord are bereft
of strength, while Dharm’s Lord is in fall, or combust the
native will go begging for his food.</p>

<p>13-25. Combinations for Father’s Death. The father of the
native would have passed away prior to the native’s birth, if
S&#363;rya is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, as Randhr’s Lord
is in Dharm Bhava, Vyaya’s Lord is in Tanu Bhava and Ari’s Lord
is in Putr Bhava. Should S&#363;rya be in Randhr Bhava, while
Randhr’s Lord is in Dharm, the native’s father will pass away
within a year of his birth. If the Lord of Vyaya Bhava is in
Dharm Bhava, while Dharm’s Lord is in its debilitation
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native’s father will face his end
during the 3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 16<sup>th</sup> year of the
native. Death of father will occur in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, or the
12<sup>th</sup> year, if Lagn’s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, as
Randhr’s Lord is with S&#363;rya. Should Rahu be in the
8<sup>th</sup> from Dharm, as S&#363;rya is in the
9<sup>th</sup> from Dharm, death of father will take place in
the 16<sup>th</sup>, or the 18<sup>th</sup> year of the native.
If &#346;ani is in the 9<sup>th</sup> from Candr, as S&#363;rya
is with Rahu, the native’s father will die in the
7<sup>th</sup>, or the 19<sup>th</sup> year of the native. The
native in his 44<sup>th</sup> year will lose his father, if
Dharm’s Lord is in Vyaya, as Vyaya’s Lord is in Dharm. If Lagn’s
Lord is in Randhr Bhava, as Candr is in S&#363;rya’s
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native in his 35<sup>th</sup>, or
41<sup>st</sup> year will lose his father. One will lose his
father in the 50<sup>th</sup> year, if S&#363;rya, being the
Lord of Dharm, is conjunct Mangal and &#346;ani. If S&#363;rya
is in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Dharm Bhava, as Rahu is in the
7<sup>th</sup> from Sahaj Bhava, the 6<sup>th</sup>, or
25<sup>th</sup> year of the native will be fatal for father. If
&#346;ani is in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Randhr Bhava, as
S&#363;rya is in the 7<sup>th</sup> from &#346;ani, the ages of
21, 26, or 30 will be fatal for the father. If Dharm’s Lord is
in its debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, while his dispositor is in
Dharm Bhava, the native will lose his father at the age of 26,
or 30. Thus the Jyotishis may know the effects.</p>

<p>26. Fortunes. One will enjoy abundant fortunes, if &#346;ukr
is in deep exaltation and be in the company of Dharm’s Lord, as
&#346;ani is in Sahaj.</p>

<p>27-28. Fortunate Periods. Abundant fortunes be acquired after
the 20<sup>th</sup> year, if Dharm has Guru in it, as its Lord
is in an angle from Lagn. Should Budh be in his deep exaltation,
as Dharm’s Lord is in Dharm itself, abundant fortunes will be
earned after the 36<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>29. Should Lagn’s Lord be in Dharm, as Dharm’s Lord is in
Lagn and Guru is in Yuvati, there will be gains of wealth and
conveyances.</p>

<p>30. Lack of Fortunes. If Rahu is in the 9<sup>th</sup> from
Dharm Bhava, as his dispositor is in Randhr Bhava and Dharm’s
Lord is in fall, the native be devoid of fortunes.</p>

<p>31. Food by Begging. Should &#346;ani be in Dharm Bhava along
with Candr, as Lagn’s Lord is in fall, the native will acquire
food by begging.</p>

<p>32. O Brahmin, these are the effects related to Dharm Bhava.
I have explained briefly. These may be estimated with the help
of the state of the Lords of Lagn and Dharm Bhava and in other
manners as well.</p>

<h2><a name=21>Ch. 21. Effects of Karm Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. I now explain the effects of Karm Bhava.  Listen to these,
o Maitreya, in the words of Brahma, Garga and others.</p>

<p>2. Paternal Happiness. If Karm’s Lord is strong and in
exaltation, or in its own R&#257;&#347;i/Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
the native will derive extreme paternal happiness, will enjoy
fame and will perform good deeds.</p>

<p>3. If Karm’s Lord is devoid of strength, the native will face
obstructions in his work. If Rahu is in an angle, or in a trine,
he will perform religious sacrifices, like Jyotishtoma.</p>

<p>4. If Karm’s Lord is with a benefic, or be in an auspicious
Bhava, one will always gain through royal patronage and in
business. In a contrary situation, only opposite results will
come to pass.</p>

<p>5. Should Karm and Labh Bhava be both occupied by malefics,
the native will indulge only in bad deeds and will defile his
own men.</p>

<p>6. If the Lord of Karm Bhava is relegated to Randhr Bhava
along with Rahu, the native will hate others; be a great fool
and will do bad deeds.</p>

<p>7. If &#346;ani, Mangal and Karm’s Lord are in Yuvati, as
Yuvati’s Lord is with a malefic, the native will be fond of
carnal pleasures and of filling his belly.</p>

<p>8-10 Should Karm’s Lord be in exaltation and be in the
company of Guru, as Dharm’s Lord is in Karm the native will be
endowed with honour, wealth and valour. One will lead a happy
life, if Labh’s Lord is in Karm and Karm’s Lord is in Lagn, or,
if the Lord of Karm Bhava is yuti with the Lord of Labh Bhava in
an angle. Should Karm’s Lord in strength be in Meen along Guru,
the native will doubtless obtain robes, ornaments and
happiness.</p>

<p>11. Should Rahu, S&#363;rya, &#346;ani and Mangal be in Labh
Bhava, the native will incur cessation of his duties.</p>

<p>12. One will be learned and wealthy, if Guru is in Meen along
with &#346;ukr, while Lagn’s Lord is strong and Candr is in
exaltation.</p>

<p>13. Should Karm’s Lord be in Labh, while Labh’s Lord is in
Tanu Bhava and &#346;ukr is in Karm, the native will be endowed
with precious stones.</p>

<p>14. If the Karm’s Lord is exalted in an angle, or a trine and
is yuti with Guru, or receives a Drishti from Guru, one will be
endowed with deeds.</p>

<p>15. Should Karm’s Lord be in Lagn along with Lagn’s Lord, as
Candr is in an angle, or in a trine, the native will be
interested in good deeds.</p>

occupied by a malefic, the native will be bereft of acts.</p>

<p>17. One will indulge in bad acts, if Karm’s Lord is in Randhr
Bhava, while Randhr’s Lord is in Karm Bhava with a malefic.</p>

<p>18. Obstructions to the native’s acts will crop up, if Karm’s
Lord is in fall, as both Karm Bhava and the 10<sup>th</sup> from
Karm Bhava have malefic occupations.</p>

<p>19-21. Combinations for Fame. One will be endowed with fame,
if Candr is in Karm Bhava, while Karm’s Lord is in a trine from
Karm Bhava and Lagn’s Lord is in Lagn’s angle. Similar effects
will come to pass, if Labh’s Lord is in Karm Bhava, while Karm’s
Lord is strong and gives a Drishti to Guru. Fame will come to
the native, if Karm’s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, as Lagn’s Lord is
in Karm Bhava and Candr is in Putr Bhava.</p>

<p>22. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have been told about
the effects of Karm Bhava in a brief manner. Other related
effects be guessed by you based on the relationship of the Lords
of Lagn and of Karm Bhava.</p>

<h2><a name=22>Ch. 22. Effects of Labh Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now explain effects
relating to Labh Bhava, the auspiciousness of which Bhava will
make one happy at all times.</p>

<p>2. Should Labh’s Lord be in Labh itself, or be in an angle,
or in a trine from Lagn, there will be many gains. Similarly, if
Labh’s Lord is exalted, though in combustion there will be many
gains.</p>

<p>3. If Labh’s Lord is in Dhan Bhava, while Dhan’s Lord is in
an angle along with Guru, the gains will be great.</p>

<p>4. If Labh’s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, while Labh Bhava is
occupied by a benefic, the native will gain 2000 Nishkas in his
36<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>5. If Labh’s Lord is yuti with a benefic in an angle, or in a
trine, the native will acquire 500 Nishkas in his
40<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>6. The native will own 6000 Nishkas, if Labh Bhava is
occupied by Guru, while Dhan Bhava and Dharm Bhava are,
respectively, taken over by Candr and &#346;ukr by position.</p>

<p>7. Should Guru, Budh and Candr be in the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Labh, the native will be endowed with wealth, grains, fortunes,
diamonds, ornaments etc.</p>

<p>8. One will gain 1000 Nishkas in his 33<sup>rd</sup> year, if
Labh’s Lord is in Lagn and Lagn’s Lord is in Labh Bhava.</p>

<p>9. If Labh’s Lord is in Dhan Bhava, as Dhan’s Lord is in Labh
Bhava, one will amass abundant fortunes after marriage.</p>

<p>10. If Labh’s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, as Sahaj’s Lord is in
Labh Bhava, one will gain wealth through co-borns and will be
endowed with excellent ornaments.</p>

<p>11. There will be no gains in spite of numerous efforts, if
Labh’s Lord is in fall, in combustion, or be in Ari, Randhr, or
Vyaya Bhava with a malefic.</p>

<h2><a name=23>Ch. 23. Effects of Vyaya Bhava</a></h2>

<p>1-4. O Brahmin, now I tell you about the effects of Vyaya
Bhava. There will be expenses on good accounts, if Vyaya’s Lord
is with a benefic, or in his own Bhava, or exalted, or, if a
benefic occupies Vyaya. One will own beautiful houses and beds
and be endowed with superior scented articles and pleasures, if
Candr happens to be Vyaya’s Lord and be exalted, or be in its
own R&#257;&#347;i and/or Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in
Labh/Dharm/Putr Bhava in R&#257;&#347;i/Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;.
The said native will live with rich clothes and ornaments, be
learned and Lordly.</p>

<p>5-6. And, if Vyaya’s Lord is in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, or be
in enemy’s Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, in debilitation
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in Randhr Bhava in
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, one will be devoid of happiness from
wife, be troubled by expenses and deprived of general happiness.
If he be in an angle, or trine, the native will beget a
spouse.</p>

<p>7. Just as these effects are derived from Tanu Bhava in
regard to the native, similar deductions be made about co-borns
etc. from Sahaj and other Bhavas.</p>

<p>8. Grahas placed in the visible half of the zodiac will give
explicit results, while the ones in the invisible half will
confer secret results.</p>

<p>9. If Rahu is in Vyaya along with Mangal, &#346;ani and
S&#363;rya, the native will go to hell. Similar effect will
occur, if Vyaya’s Lord is with S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>10. If there is a benefic in Vyaya, while its Lord is
exalted, or is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic,
one will attain final emancipation.</p>

<p>11. One will wander from country to country, if Vyaya’s Lord
and Vyaya Bhava are with malefics and Vyaya’s Lord gives a
Drishti to, or receives a Drishti from malefics.</p>

<p>12. One will move in his own country, if Vyaya’s Lord and
Vyaya Bhava are with benefics and Vyaya’s Lord gives a Drishti
to, or receives a Drishti from benefics.</p>

<p>13. Earnings will be through sinful measures, if Vyaya is
occupied by &#346;ani, or Mangal etc. and is not receiving a
Drishti from a benefic.</p>

<p>14. If Lagn’s Lord is in Vyaya, while Vyaya’s Lord is in Lagn
with &#346;ukr, expenses will be on religious grounds.</p>

effects according to its strength being full, medium and
negligible, respectively. Thus I have told you about the

<p>86-87. O Brahmin, these are the effects for Dhum etc. Before
declaring these results, the effects of S&#363;rya and other
Grahas should be wisely conceived by their positions, relations
and Drishtis apart from their strength, or weakness.</p>

<h2><a name=26>Ch. 26. Evaluation of Drishtis of Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Glorious, it is said, that Drishtis (of Grahas) and
their strengths are to be known in deciding the effects. How
many kinds are these? Please clarify doubts.</p>

<p>2-5. Drishtis of the Grahas. O Brahmin, I have earlier stated
Drishtis, based on R&#257;&#347;is. The other kind is between
Grahas, which I detail below. 3<sup>rd</sup> and
10<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>,
4<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> and lastly 7<sup>th</sup>.  On
these places the Drishtis increase gradually in slabs of
quarters, i.e &frac14;, &frac12;, &frac34; and full. The effects
will also be proportionate.  All Grahas give a Drishti to the
7<sup>th</sup> fully. &#346;ani, Guru and Mangal have special
Drishtis, respectively, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the
10<sup>th</sup>, the 5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> and
the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 8<sup>th</sup>. The ancient
preceptors have explained these, which ordinary. By subtle
mathematical calculations these Drishtis will have to be clearly
understood, as under.</p>

<p>6-8. Evaluation of the Drishtis of the Grahas. Deduct the
longitude of the Grah (or Bhava), that receives a Drishti, from
that of the Grah, which gives the Drishti. If the sum exceeds
six R&#257;&#347;is, deduct the sum again from 10
R&#257;&#347;is. Convert the latter sum into degrees and divide
by two. The resultant product is Drishti Kona (or aspectual
angle). If the difference is in excess of 5 R&#257;&#347;is,
ignore the R&#257;&#347;is and multiply the degrees etc. by 2,
which is the value of the Drishti. If the difference is in
excess of 4 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct it from 5 R&#257;&#347;is,
and the resultant degees etc. become the Drishti value. If the
difference is in excess of 3 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct it from 4
R&#257;&#347;is and (increase 30 by) halve the product to get
the Drishti value. If the difference is above 2 R&#257;&#347;is,
ignore the R&#257;&#347;is and add 15 to the degrees etc. to get
the Drishti value. If it is in excess of one R&#257;&#347;i,
ignore the R&#257;&#347;is and divide the degrees by 2 to get
the Drishti value.</p>

<p>9-10. Special consideration for &#346;ani’s Drishtis. O
Brahmin, if &#346;ani is the Grah, that gives a Drishti, find
out the difference between him and the Grah, that receives the
Drishti; if the sum is above 1 R&#257;&#347;i, multiply the
degrees etc. by 2 to get the Drishti value. If the sum is above
nine R&#257;&#347;is, the degrees to elapse be doubled to get
the Drishti value. If the sum is above 2 R&#257;&#347;is, the
degrees etc. be halved and deducted from 60. If the sum exceeds
8 R&#257;&#347;is, add to the degrees etc. a figure of 30 to get
the Drishti value.  In other cases, the sums be processed, as
explained earlier.</p>

<p>11. Special consideration for Mangal’s Drishtis. Deduct the
longitude of Mangal from that of the Grah, that receives the
Drishti. If the sum is 3 R&#257;&#347;is &amp; c, or 7
R&#257;&#347;is &amp; c, the degrees etc. be reduced from 60. If
it is above 2 R&#257;&#347;is, the degrees etc. be increased by
half of it and superadd 15.  If the sum is 6 R&#257;&#347;is,
one Rup is the value.</p>

<p>12. Special consideration for Guru’s Drishtis. Deduct the
longitude of Guru from that of the Grah, that receives the
Drishti from Guru. If the resultant sum is 3 R&#257;&#347;is
&amp; c, or 7 R&#257;&#347;is &amp; c, halve the degrees etc.
and increase it by 15. It the sum is 4 R&#257;&#347;is &amp; c,
or 8 R&#257;&#347;is &amp; c, the degrees etc. be subtracted
from 60. This will be the Drishti value. The sum, being in
conformity with others than these, be treated, as stated
earlier.</p>

<h2><a name=27>Ch. 27. Evaluation Of Strengths</a></h2>

<p>Shad Bal consists of the following: Sthan Bal (positional),
Dig Bal (directional), Kaal Bal (Temporal), inclusive of Ayan
Bal (equinoctial), Chesht Bal (motional), Naisargika Bal
(natural), Drik Bal (aspectual). These strengths are computed
for the seven Grahas from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani. The nodes are
not considered.</p>

<p>Sthan Bal comprises of the following considerations: Uchch
Bal (exaltation), Sapt Vargaj Bal (strength accruing out of
positions in R&#257;&#347;i, Hora, Dreshkan,
Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;, Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347; and Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;),
OjhayugmaR&#257;&#347;i&#257;&#324;&#347; Bal (acquired by
placement in odd, or even R&#257;&#347;i and in odd, or even
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;), Kendradi Bal (due to placement in Kon,
or Panaphara, or Apoklima Bhava), Dreshkan Bal (due to placement
in first, second, or third decanate of a R&#257;&#347;i).</p>

<p>Kaal Bal comprises of the following subdivisions: Nathonnata
Bal (diurnal and nocturnal), Paksh Bal (fortnight), Tribhag Bal
(due to day/night being made in 3 parts), Varsh, Maas, Dina and
Hora Bal (Varsh - astrological year, Maas - month, Dina -
weekday and Hora - planetary hour), Ayan Bal (equinoctial),
Yudhdh Bal (due to partaking in war between Grahas).</p>

<p>1-1&frac12;. Sthan Bal (up to Sloka 6).  Firstly Uchch Bal.
Now about the strengths by classes positional, temporal etc.
Deduct from the longitude of the Grah its (deep) debilitation
point. If the sum is less than 6 R&#257;&#347;is, consider it,
as it is; if it exceeds 6 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct the same from
12 R&#257;&#347;is. The sum so got be converted into degrees
etc. and divided by 3, which is the Grah’s Uchch Bal in
Virupas.</p>

<p>2-4. Sapt Vargaj Bal. If a Grah is in its Mooltrikon
R&#257;&#347;i, it gets 45 Virupas, in Svasth R&#257;&#347;i 30
Virupas, in Pramudit R&#257;&#347;i 20 Virupas, in Shant
R&#257;&#347;i 15 Virupas, in Din R&#257;&#347;i 10 Virupas, in
Duhkhit R&#257;&#347;i 4 Virupas and in Khal R&#257;&#347;i 2
Virupas. Similarly these values occur for the other 6 divisional
occupations, viz. Hora, Dreshkan, Sapt&#257;&#324;&#347;,
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347; and
Trimsh&#257;&#324;&#347;.  When all these are added together the
Grah’s Sapt Vargaj Bal emerges.</p>

<p>4&frac12;.  OjhayugmaR&#257;&#347;i&#257;&#324;&#347; Bal.
Each of &#346;ukr and Candr in even R&#257;&#347;is and others
in odd R&#257;&#347;is acquire a quarter of Rupa. These are
applicable to such Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as also.</p>

<p>5. Kendradi Bal. A Grah in a Kon gets full strength, while
one in Panaphara Bhava gets half and the one in Apoklima Bhava
gets a quarter, as Kendradi Bal.</p>

<p>6. Dreshkan Bal. Male, female and hermaphrodite Grahas,
respectively, get a quarter Rupa according to placements in the
first, second and third decanates.</p>

<p>7-7&frac12;. Dig Bal. Deduct Bandhu Bhava (Nadir) from the
longitudes of S&#363;rya and Mangal, Yuvati Bhava from that of
Guru and Budh, Karm Bhava from that of &#346;ukr and Candr and
lastly Lagn from that of &#346;ani. If the sum is above 180
degrees, deduct the sum from 360. The sum arrived in either way
be divided by 3, which will be Dig Bal of the Grah.</p>

<p>8-9. Kaal Bal (up to Sloka 17). Firstly Nathonnata Bal. Find
out the difference between midnight and the apparent birth time,
which is called Unnata. Deduct Unnata from 30 Ghatis to obtain
Nata.  Double the Nata in Ghatis, which will indicate identical
Nata Bal for Candr, Mangal and &#346;ani. Deduct the Nata from
60 to know the Unnata Bal of S&#363;rya, Guru and &#346;ukr.
Budh, irrespective of day and night, gets full Nathonnata
Bal.</p>

<p>10-11. Paksh Bal. Deduct from Candr’s longitude that of
S&#363;rya. If the sum exceeds 6 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct the
same from 12. The product so obtained be converted into degrees
etc. and divided by 3, which will indicate the Paksh Bal of each
of the benefic Grahas.  The Paksh Bal of benefic should be
deducted from 60, which will go to each malefic, as Paksh
Bal.</p>

<p>12. Tribagh Bal. One Rupa is obtained by Budh in the first
1/3 part of day time, by S&#363;rya in the second 1/3 part of
the day and by &#346;ani in the last 1/3 part of the day.
Similarly Candr, &#346;ukr and Mangal get full Bal in the first,
second and last 1/3 parts of the night. Guru gets this Bal at
all times.</p>

<p>13. Varsh-Maas-Dina-Hora Bal. 15, 30, 45 and 60 Virupas are
in order given to Varsh Lord, Maas Lord, Dina Lord and Hora
Lord. Naisargika Bal has already been explained.</p>

<p>The Varsh Lord is the Lord of the day, on which the
astrological year of birth starts. To calculate this we first
need the number of days, past from the beginning of Creation,
the Ahargan. According to late Rev. Ebenezer Burgess, who
translated S&#363;rya Siddhanta in English, as on January 1,
1860, the number of days, past from the beginning of Creation
are 714,404,108,573. Divide the number of days, past from the
day of Creation till the day of birth, by 60. Reject remainder
and multiply the quotient by 3.  Increase the post-multiplied
product by 1 and divide by 7. The remainder will indicate the
week day, on which the astrological year, giving birth to the
native, opened. Remainder 1 indicates Sunday, 2 Monday and so
on.</p>

<p>Maas Lord. Divide the same Ahargan by 30 and the quotient
indicates months, passed from Creation to birth. The completed
months be multiplied by 2 and increased by 1. The latter sum
should be divided by 7 and the remainder indicates, on which day
the birth month began.  Continuing with the same case, we divide
65295 by 30. Quotient is 2176. This sum multiplied by 2 and
increased by 1 denotes 4353. Dividing 4353 by 7, we get a
remainder of 6, denoting Friday. That is, the month of birth
began on Friday and the Maas Bal goes to &#346;ukr, the Lord of
Friday.</p>

<p>Dina Lord. Though the week day of birth can be known from
ephemeris, or perpetual calendars, we better adopt the method
prescribed, which will confirm, if the Ahargan followed is
correct. The number of days, as arrived above, indicating
Ahargan, be divided by 7 and the remainder will indicate the
week day of birth.</p>

<p>Hora Bal. Hora means planetary hour. Each day from sunrise to
sunrise is divided into 24 equal parts of one hour. These Horas
are ruled by the 7 Grahas from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani. The
first Hora of the day is ruled by the Lord of the week day. The
2<sup>nd</sup> one is ruled by the Lord of the 6<sup>th</sup>
week day, counted from the first ruler. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Hora
is ruled by the Lord of the 6<sup>th</sup> week day, counted
from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hora Lord. Similarly it proceeds in the
same manner, till the first Hora of the next day is taken over
by the Lord of that day himself. Whichever Grah rules the birth
Hora, gets the Hora Bal. Horas are to be calculated for mean
local time and not standard time of births.</p>

<p>14. Naisargika Bal. Divide one Rupa by 7 and multiply the
resultant product by 1 to 7 separately, which will indicate the
Naisargika Bal, due to &#346;ani, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr,
Candr and S&#363;rya, respectively.</p>

<p>15-17. Ayan Bal. 45, 33 and 12 are the Khandas for
calculating Ayan Bal. Add Ayan&#257;&#324;&#347; to the Grah and
find out the Bhuja (distance from the nearest equinox). Add the
figure, corresponding to the R&#257;&#347;i (of the Bhuja) to
the Bhuja. The degrees etc. of the Bhuja should be multiplied by
the figure, corresponding to the highest of the left out Khandas
and divided by 30. Add the resultant product to the sum,
obtained earlier. Convert this to R&#257;&#347;i, degrees,
minutes and seconds. If Candr and &#346;ani are in Tula, or
ahead, add to this 3 R&#257;&#347;is and, if in Mesh to Kanya,
reduce from this 3 R&#257;&#347;is.  Similarly it is reverse for
S&#363;rya, Mangal, &#346;ukr and Guru. For Budh 3
R&#257;&#347;is are always additive. The resultant sum in
R&#257;&#347;i, degrees and minutes be divided by 3 to get the
Ayan Bal in Rupas.</p>

<p>Notes. Ayan Bal can be found out on the following simple
formula: Ayan Bal = 60*(23°27’ + Kranti)/(46°54’) = (23°27’±
Kranti)*1.2793.</p>

<p>The following points have to be remembered in respect of
Krantis. When Candr, or &#346;ani have southern Kranti, or, when
S&#363;rya, Mangal, Guru, or &#346;ukr have northern Kranti,
take plus.  In a contrary situation in respect of these 6
Grahas, take minus. As far as Budh is concerned, it is always
plus. Krantis (or declinations) can be ascertained from a
standard modern ephemeris.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya’s Ayan Bal is again multiplied by 2 whereas for
others the product arrived in Virupas is considered, as it
is.</p>

<p>18. Motional Strength for S&#363;rya and Candr. S&#363;rya’s
Chesht Bal will correspond to his Ayan Bal. Candr’s Paksh Bal
will itself be her Chesht Bal.</p>

<p>19. Drik Bal. Reduce one fourth of the Drishti Pinda, if a
Grah receives malefic Drishtis and add a fourth, if it receives
a Drishti from a benefic. Super add the entire Drishti of Budh
and Guru to get the net strength of a Grah.</p>

<p>20. War Between Grahas. Should there be a war between the
starry Grahas, the difference between the Shad Balas of the two
should be added to the victor’s Shad Bal and deducted from the
Shad Bal of the vanquished.</p>

<p>21-23. Motions of Grahas (Mangal to &#346;ani). Eight kinds
of motions are attributed to Grahas. These are Vakr
(retrogression), Anuvakr (entering the previous R&#257;&#347;i
in retrograde motion), Vikal (devoid of motion), Mand (somewhat
slower motion than usual), Mandatar (slower than the previous),
Sama (somewhat increasing in motion), Char (faster than Sama)
and Atichar (entering next R&#257;&#347;i in accelerated
motion). The strengths, allotted due to such 8 motions are 60,
30, 15, 30, 15, 7.5, 45 and 30.</p>

<p>24-25. Motional Strength for Mangal etc. Add together the
mean and true longitudes of a Grah and divide the one by two.
Reduce this sum from the Seeghroch (or apogee) of the Grah. The
resultant product will indicate the Chesht Kendra (or Seeghr
Kendra) of the Grah from 12 R&#257;&#347;is. The R&#257;&#347;i,
degrees and minutes so arrived should be converted into degrees,
minutes etc. and divided by 3, which will denote the motional
strength of the Grah. Thus there are six sources of strength,
called Sthan Bal, Dig Bal, Kaal Bal, Drik Bal, Chesht Bal and
Naisargika Bal.</p>

<p>26-29. Bhava Balas. Thus I explained about the strengths of
the Grahas. Deduct Yuvati Bhava from the Bhava, if the Bhava
happens to be in Kanya, Mithun, Tula, Kumbh, or the first half
of Dhanu. If Mesh, Vrishabh, Simh, or first half of Makar, or
the second half of Dhanu happen to be the Bhava, deduct Bandhu
Bhava from it. Should the Bhava be in Kark, or in Vrischik,
deduct from it Lagn. Deduct Karm Bhava from the Bhava, happening
to fall in Makar second half, or Meen. Convert the product so
obtained into degrees etc. and divide by 3 to get Bhava Bal. If
the balance in the process of deducting Nadir, Meridian, Lagn,
or Yuvati exceeds 6 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct it again from 12
R&#257;&#347;is, before converting into degrees and dividing by
3. The product after division should be increased by one fourth,
if the Bhava in question receives a benefic Drishti. If the
Bhava receives a malefic Drishti, one fourth should be reduced.
If Guru, or Budh give a Drishti to a Bhava, add that Grah’s Drik
Bal also. And then superadd the strength, acquired by the Lord
of that Bhava. This will be the net Bhava Bal.</p>

<p>30-31. Special Rules. The Bhavas, occupied by Guru and Budh
will each get an addition of 1 Rupa, while each of the Bhavas,
occupied by &#346;ani, Mangal and S&#363;rya, suffer 1 Rupa
reduction. 15 Virupas will have to be added to the Bhavas,
falling in Seershodaya R&#257;&#347;is, if birth happens to be
in day time, to the Bhavas, falling in Dual R&#257;&#347;is, if
birth happens to be in twilight and to the Bhavas, falling in
Prishtodaya R&#257;&#347;is, if birth be in night time.</p>

<p>32-33. Shad Bal Requirements. 390, 360, 300, 420, 390, 330
and 300 Virupas are the Shad Bal Pindas, needed for S&#363;rya
etc. to be considered strong. If the strength exceeds the
above-mentioned values, the Grah is deemed to be very strong. If
a Grah has the required Shad Bal, it will prove favourable to
the native by virtue of its strength. However, &#346;ani’s
extreme strength will give long life as well as miseries.</p>

<p>34-36. Guru, Budh and S&#363;rya are strong, if each of their
Sthan Bal, Dig Bal, Kaal Bal, Chesht Bal and Ayan Bal are,
respectively, 165, 35, 50, 112 and 30 Virupas. The same required
for Candr and &#346;ukr are 133, 50, 30, 100 and 40. For Mangal
and &#346;ani these are 96, 30, 40, 67 and 20.</p>

<p>37-38. Bhava Effects. O Brahmin, thus the various sources of
strengths be gathered together and effects declared.  Whatever
Yogas, or effects have been stated with respect to a Bhava, will
come to pass through the strongest Grah.</p>

<p>39-40. Eligibility of Issue Fruitful Predictions.  O
Maitreya, the words of one, who has achieved skill in
mathematics, one, who has put in industrious efforts in the
branch of grammar, one, who has knowledge of justice, one, who
is intelligent, one, who has knowledge of geography, space and
time, one, who has conquered his senses, one, who is skilfully
logical (in estimation) and one, who is favourable to Jyotish,
will doubtless be truthful.</p>

<h2><a name=28>Ch. 28. Isht and Kasht Balas</a></h2>

<p>1. Now I narrate the benefic and malefic tendencies of the
Grahas, based on which the Dasha effects can be decided.</p>

<p>2. Exaltation Rays. Deduct the Grah’s debilitation point from
its actual position. If the sum exceeds 6 R&#257;&#347;is,
deduct from 12 R&#257;&#347;is. The said sum should then be
increased by 1 R&#257;&#347;i. The degrees etc. be multiplied by
2, which, when considered along with R&#257;&#347;is, will
indicate the Uchch Rasmi of the Grah.</p>

<p>3-4. Chesht Rasmi. Chesht Rasmis are to be calculated from
Chesht Kendr similar to Uchch Rasmi computations. The Chesht
Kendras of Grahas from Mangal to &#346;ani have already been
explained.  Add 3 R&#257;&#347;is to Sayan S&#363;rya (i.e. with
Ayan&#257;&#324;&#347;), which will be the Chesht Kendr for
S&#363;rya. The sidereal longitude of S&#363;rya should be
deducted from Candr to get Candr’s Chesht Kendr. If the Chesht
Kendr (for any Grah) is in excess of 6 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct
it from 12 R&#257;&#347;is. Add 1 R&#257;&#347;i and multiply
the degrees etc. by 2, which will indicate the Chesht Rasmi of
the Grah.</p>

<p>5. Benefic and Malefic Rays. Add the Uchch Rasmis and Chesht
Rasmis together and divide by two. The result will be auspicious
rays (Subh Rasmis). Deduct from 8 the Subh Rasmis to obtain
inauspicious rays (Asubh Rasmis).</p>

<p>6. Isht and Kasht Tendencies. Reduce 1 from each of Chesht
Rasmi and Uchch Rasmi. Then multiply the products by 10 and add
together. Half of the sum will represent the Isht Phala (benefic
tendency) of the Grah. Reduce Isht Phala from 60 to obtain the
Grah’s Kasht Phala (malefic tendency).</p>

<p>7-9. Isht and Kasht and Sapt Varg Phal. 60, 45, 30, 22, 15,
8, 4, 2 and 0 are the Subhankas (Subha Griha Pankthis, benefic
points), due to a Grah’s placement, respectively, in exaltation,
Mooltrikon, own, great friend’s, friend’s, neutral, enemy’s,
great enemy’s and debilitation R&#257;&#347;i. If Subhanka is
deducted from 60, Asubhanka (Asubh Pankthi, inauspicious points)
will emerge. O Brahmin, in other Vargas these are halved.</p>

<p>10. A Grah is considered auspicious in the first five of the
said places. In the sixth place it is neutral, i.e. neither good
nor bad. And in the other three places it is inauspicious.</p>

<p>11-12. Nature of Effects, due to Dig Bal etc. The directional
strength of a Grah is itself representative of the effects, due
to the direction; and Kaal Bal itself is indicative of effects,
due to the day. Whatever quantum of Dig Bal etc. are obtained by
a Grah, will be the extent of auspicious effects, acquirable on
account of that strength.  Deducting those figures from 60, the
extent of inauspiciousness is known. If auspiciousness is more
in the case of a Grah’s strength, the Dasha and Bhavas, related
to that Grah will be auspicious. These are converse, if
inauspiciousness is predominant.</p>

<p>13-14. Sapt Varg Phal and Isht and Kasht (Continued). The
various strengths (i.e. the other 6 Vargas) be multiplied by the
respective Grah’s Shad Bal Pinda, which will indicate the
auspiciousness of the Varg concerned. Auspicious, or
inauspicious aspect will be by multiplying the Subh, or Asubh
Pankthi. Similarly auspicious, or inauspicious effects will be
known by multiplying the auspicious, or inauspicious strength by
the respective Pankthi.</p>

<p>15-20. Effects of a Bhava. The strength of a Bhava and its
Lord have already been explained. The actual effects will be a
combination of Bhava strength and its Lord’s strength. If there
is a benefic in the Bhava add the same to the auspicious effects
and deduct from inauspicious effects, which will denote the
inauspicious effects. If a malefic is in the Bhava, reverse the
process, i.e. add inauspicious effects and deduct auspicious
effects. Similarly Drishtis and Balas. If a Grah is exalted, or
with such a dignity, add auspicious effects and reduce
inauspicious effects. For debilitation etc. it is converse. In
Ashtak Varg add Bindus (auspicious points) and deduct Karanas
(inauspicious points). If a Bhava extends to two
R&#257;&#347;is, the rectification will be done, as per both the
Lords. In that case, whichever R&#257;&#347;i has more Bindus,
that R&#257;&#347;i will yield more favourable results,
concerning that Bhava. If both the R&#257;&#347;is have more
auspicious Bindus, take the average. Thus the auspicious and
inauspicious effects of a Bhava be understood.</p>

<h2><a name=29>Ch. 29. Bhava Padas</a></h2>

<p>1-3. Method of Bhava Calculation. O Brahmin, I shall now tell
you about the Padas (Arudhas) for Bhavas and Grahas as well, as
laid down by the earlier Maharishis. The Pad of Lagn will
correspond to the R&#257;&#347;i, arrived at by counting so many
R&#257;&#347;is from Lagn’s Lord, as he is away from Tanu Bhava.
Similarly Padas for other Bhavas be known through their Lords.
The word “Pad” exclusively denotes the Pad for Lagn.</p>

<p>Names of the 12 Arudhas are Lagn Pad - Arudh of Tanu Bhava,
Dhan of Dhan, Vikram (Bhratru) of Sahaj, Matru (Sukh) of Bandhu,
Mantra (Putr) of Putr, Rog (Satru) of Ari, Dar (Kalatr) of
Yuvati, Maran of Randhr, Pitru of Dharm Bhava, Karm of Karm,
Labh of Labh, Vyaya of Vyaya.</p>

<p>4-5. Special Exceptions. The same Bhava, or the
7<sup>th</sup> from it does not become its Pad. When the Pad
falls in the same Bhava, the 10<sup>th</sup> therefrom be
treated, as its Pad. Similarly, when the 7<sup>th</sup> becomes
the Pad of a Bhava, the 4<sup>th</sup> from the original Bhava
in question be treated, as its Pad. If the ruler of a Bhava be
in the 4<sup>th</sup> from the Bhava, then the very Bhava
occupied be noted, as the Pad.</p>

<p>6-7. Padas for Grahas. Note the position of a Grah and see
how many R&#257;&#347;is away is its own R&#257;&#347;i with
reference to its position. Count so many R&#257;&#347;is from
the said own R&#257;&#347;i and the resultant R&#257;&#347;i
will become the Arudh of the Grah. If a Grah owns two
R&#257;&#347;is, or, if a R&#257;&#347;i is owned by two Grahas;
consider the stronger and declare effects accordingly.</p>

<p>8-11. Pad and Finance (up to Sloka 15). O Brahmin, I now tell
you of some effects of Grahas, based on Pad. If the
11<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad is occupied, or receives a Drishti
from a Grah the native will be happy and rich; wealth will come
through various means, if a benefic is related, as above. A
malefic will confer wealth through questionable means. If there
be both a benefic and a malefic, it will be through both means.
If the Grah in question be in exaltation, or in own
R&#257;&#347;i etc., there will be plenty of gains and plenty of
happiness.</p>

<p>12. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Lagn Pad does not receive a Drishti, as the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Lagn Pad receives a Drishti from a Grah, then the gains will be
uninterrupted.</p>

<p>13-15. O Brahmin, the quantum of gains will correspond to the
number of Grahas in, or giving a Drishti to the 11<sup>th</sup>
from Lagn Pad. If there is Argala for the said 11<sup>th</sup>,
there will be more gains, while a benefic Argala will bring
still more gains. If the said benefic, causing Argala is in his
exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, the gains will be still higher. If
the said 11<sup>th</sup> receives a Drishti from a benefic from
Lagn, the 9<sup>th</sup> etc., gains will increase in the
ascending order.  In all these cases, the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Pad should simultaneously be free from malefic association. A
benefic, placed in Lagn, giving a Drishti to the 11<sup>th</sup>
from Arudh Lagn will be still beneficial. If the Drishti is from
the 9<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, it will confer much more
gains.</p>

<p>16-17. Pad and Financial Losses (up to Sloka 21). If the
12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad receives a Drishti from, or is
yuti with both benefics and malefics, there will be abundant
earnings, but plenty of expenses. The benefic will cause through
fair means, malefic through unfair means and mixed Grahas
through both fair and unfair means.</p>

<p>18. If the 12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad is conjunct
S&#363;rya, &#346;ukr and Rahu, there will be loss of wealth
through the king. Candr, giving a Drishti to (the said trio in
the said Bhava), will specifically cause more such losses.</p>

<p>19. If Budh is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad and is
yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic, similarly there
will be expenses through paternal relatives. A malefic so
related to the said Budh will cause loss of wealth through
disputes.</p>

<p>20. O Brahmin, if Guru is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn
Pad, receiving a Drishti from others, the expenses will be
through taxes and on the person himself.</p>

<p>21. O Brahmin, if &#346;ani is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Lagn Pad along with Mangal and receives a Drishti from others,
the expenses will be through one’s co-born.</p>

<p>22. Gainful Sources. Whatever sources of expenses are
indicated above with reference to the 12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn
Pad, gains through similar sources will occur, if Labh Bhava so
features with reference to Lagn Pad.</p>

<p>23. The 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Pad (up to Sloka 27). If
Rahu, or Ketu is placed in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, the
native will be troubled by disorders of the stomach, or by
fire.</p>

<p>24. Should there be Ketu in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad,
receiving a Drishti from, or being yuti with another malefic,
the native will be adventurous, will have (prematurely) grey
hair and a big male organ.</p>

<p>25. Should one, two, or all three of Guru, &#346;ukr and
Candr be in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, the native will be
very wealthy.</p>

<p>26. Whether a benefic, or a malefic, if be exalted in the
7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, the native will be affluent and be
famous.</p>

<p>27. O Brahmin, these Yogas, as narrated by me with reference
to the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, should also be considered
from the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Lagn Pad.</p>

<p>28. Anyone of Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr being exalted in the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Lagn Pad and being with strength will make
the subject rich.</p>

<p>29. The Yogas so far stated by me with reference to Lagn Pad
be similarly evaluated from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; as well.</p>

<p>30-37. General. If Budh is in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Arudh
Lagn, the native will Lord over the whole country. &#346;ukr in
the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Lagn Pad will make one a poet, or a
speaker. If the Dar Pad falls in an angle, or in a trine,
counted from Lagn Pad, or, if Lagn Pad and Dar Pad both have
strong Grahas, the native will be rich and be famous in his
country. If the Dar Pad falls in the 6<sup>th</sup>/
8<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, then the native
will be poor. If Lagn Pad and the 7<sup>th</sup> therefrom, or
an angle, a trine, an Upachaya therefrom is occupied by a strong
Grah, there will be happiness between the husband and wife. If
Lagn Pad and Dar Pad are mutually in Kendras, or Konas, there
will be amity between the couple.  If these be in mutually
6<sup>th</sup>/8<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup>, doubtlessly
mutual enmity will crop up. O Brahmin, similarly mutual
relationship, or gain, or loss through son etc. be known, based
on Lagn Pad and the relative Bhava Pad. If Lagn Pad and Dar Pad
are mutually angular, or 3<sup>rd</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, or
in Konas, the native will be a king, ruling the earth.  Similar
deductions be made with reference to mutual positions of Lagn
Pad and Dhan Pad.</p>

<h2><a name=30>Ch. 30. Upa Pad</a></h2>

<p>1-6. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Upa Pad, the
auspiciousness of which will confer on the native happiness from
progeny, wife etc. The Pad of Lagn, as discussed earlier, is of
prime importance. Upa Pad is calculated for the Bhava, following
the natal Lagn. This Upa Pad is also called Gaun Pad. O
excellent of the Brahmins, if Upa Pad is yuti with, or receives
a Drishti from a benefic Grah, one will obtain full happiness
from progeny and spouse. Should the Upa Pad be in a malefic’s
R&#257;&#347;i, or receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a
malefic, one will become an ascetic and go without a wife. If
(in the said circumstances) there be a benefic Drishti (on Upa
Pad, or the related malefic), or a yuti, deprival of spouse will
not come to pass. In this case S&#363;rya, being exalted, or in
a friendly R&#257;&#347;i, is not a malefic. He is a malefic, if
in debilitation, or in an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>Notes. Regarding Upa Pad calculations, there are more than
two views on the same Sloka of Maharishi Parashar, or an
identical Sutra from Jaimini. In this text, the word ‘Anuchar’
is used, which denotes ‘the Bhava, following the Lagn at birth’.
Normally this is Vyaya Bhava.  However, when we study other
commentaries on Jaimini (Chaukhambh Hindi edition), we are
taught, that it is Vyaya Bhava in the case of an odd
R&#257;&#347;i ascending and it is Dhan Bhava in the case of an
even R&#257;&#347;i ascending.  Accordingly the Pad for the
12<sup>th</sup>, or the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Lagn is called Upa
Pad. In calculating Upa Pad the rules mentioned in verses 4 and
5 of the previous chapter be kept in mind.</p>

<p>7-12. Effect from the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad. If the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad is a benefic R&#257;&#347;i, or
receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, the same
good results (as for wife and sons) will come to pass. If there
is a Grah in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad in its debilitation
R&#257;&#347;i, or debilitation A&#324;&#347;, or is yuti with a
debilitated, or malefic Grah, there will be destruction of wife.
If the said occupant be in its exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, or
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or receives a Drishti from another Grah,
there will be many charming and virtuous wives. Oh Brahmin, if
Mithun happens to be the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad, then also
there will be many wives. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the
Upa Pad, or the 2<sup>nd</sup> therefrom be occupied by its own
Lord, or, if the said Lord is in his other own Bhava, the death
of wife will be at advanced age.</p>

<p>13-15. Wife from the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Upa Pad (up to Sloka
22). If a Grah being constant indicator of wife (i.e. the
7<sup>th</sup> Lord, or &#346;ukr) is in its own Bhava, there
will be loss of wife only at a later stage. If the Lord of Upa
Pad, or the constant significator of wife is in exaltation, the
wife will be from a noble family. Reverse will be the case, if
he is debilitated. O Brahmin, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad
is related to a benefic, the wife will be beautiful, fortunate
and virtuous.</p>

<p>16. Should &#346;ani and Rahu be in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from
Upa Pad, the native will lose his wife on account of calumny, or
through death.</p>

<p>17. The native’s wife will be troubled by disorder of blood,
leucorrhoea (Pradar) etc., if &#346;ukr and Ketu are in the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad.</p>

<p>18. Budh with Ketu in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad will
cause breakage of bones, while Rahu, &#346;ani and S&#363;rya
will cause distress of bones.</p>

<p>19-22. Budh and Rahu in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad will
give a stout-bodied wife. If the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad
happens to be one of Budh’s R&#257;&#347;is and is tenanted by
Mangal and &#346;ani, the wife of the native will suffer from
nasal disorders. Similarly a R&#257;&#347;i of Mangal, becoming
the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad and occupied by Mangal and
&#346;ani, will cause nasal disorders to one’s wife. Guru and
&#346;ani will, if be in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad, cause
disorders of ears and/or eyes to the wife. If Budh and Mangal
are placed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad other than their
own R&#257;&#347;is, or, if Rahu is with Guru in the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad, the native’s wife will suffer from
dental disorders. &#346;ani and Rahu together in one of
&#346;ani’s R&#257;&#347;is, which is the 2<sup>nd</sup> from
Upa Pad, will cause lameness, or windy disorders to the native’s
wife. These evils will not come to pass, if there happens to be
a Yuti with, or a Drishti from a benefic (or from another
benefic in the case of affliction being caused by a benefic
himself).</p>

<p>23-23&frac12;. O Brahmin, all these effects be deduced from
the natal Lagn, Lagn Pad, the 7<sup>th</sup> from Upa Pad and
the Lords thereof. So say Narada and others.</p>

<p>25-28. About Sons. If &#346;ani, Candr and Budh are together
in the 9<sup>th</sup> from one of the said places (Sloka 23),
there will be no son at all, while S&#363;rya, Guru and Rahu so
placed will give a number of sons. Candr so placed will give a
son, while a mixture of Grahas will delay the obtainment of a
son. The son, caused by the Yuti of S&#363;rya, Guru and Rahu,
will be strong, valorous, greatly successful and will destroy
enemies. If Mangal and &#346;ani are in the said 9<sup>th</sup>,
there will be no son, or a son will be obtained by adoption, or
brother’s son will come in adoption. In all these cases odd
R&#257;&#347;is will yield many sons, while even R&#257;&#347;is
will cause only a few.</p>

<p>29-30. Many Sons and Many Daughters. O Brahmin, if Simh
happens to be Upa Pad and receives a Drishti from Candr, there
will be a limited number of children. Similarly Kanya will cause
many daughters.</p>

<p>31. Co-born form Lagn Pad (up to Sloka 36).  Rahu and
&#346;ani in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Lagn Pad will destroy the co-born of the native. Rahu and
&#346;ani in the 11<sup>th</sup> will indicate the destruction
of elder brothers and/or sisters and in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
younger ones.</p>

<p>32. If &#346;ukr is in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, or the
11<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, there would have been an abortion
to the mother earlier. Same is the effect, if &#346;ukr is in
the 8<sup>th</sup> from natal Lagn, or from Lagn Pad.</p>

<p>33-36. These are the effects, o Brahmin, as stated by
Maharishis for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Lagn Pad. Should Candr, Guru, Budh and Mangal be in the
3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, there will
be many valorous co-born. Should &#346;ani and Mangal be in the
3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad, or give
Drishtis thereto, younger and elder co-born will, respectively,
be destroyed. If &#346;ani is alone in one of the said Bhavas,
the native will be spared, while the co-born will die. Ketu in
the 3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> will give abundant
happiness from one’s sisters.</p>

<p>37. Other Matters from Lagn Pad (up to Sloka 43). If the
6<sup>th</sup> from Lagn Pad is occupied by a malefic and is
bereft of a Yuti with, or a Drishti from a benefic, the native
will be a thief.</p>

<p>38. If Rahu is in the 7<sup>th</sup>, or the 12<sup>th</sup>
from Lagn Pad, or gives a Drishti to one of the said Bhavas, the
native will be endowed with spiritual knowledge and be very
fortunate.</p>

<p>39. If Budh is in Lagn Pad, the native will Lord over a whole
country, while Guru will make him a knower of all things.
&#346;ukr in this context denotes a poet/speaker (also see Ch.
29, verse 30).</p>

<p>40. O excellent of the Brahmins, if benefics occupy the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad, or from Lagn Pad, the native will
be endowed with all kinds of wealth and be intelligent.</p>

<p>41. One will surely become a thief, if the Lord of the
2<sup>nd</sup> from Upa Pad is in Dhan Bhava and is there yuti
with a malefic Grah.</p>

<p>42-43. O Brahmin, if Rahu is in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from the
Lord of the 7<sup>th</sup>, counted from Upa Pad, the native
will have long and projected teeth. Ketu in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
from the Lord of the 7<sup>th</sup>, counted from Upa Pad, will
cause stammering and &#346;ani in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from the
Lord of the 7<sup>th</sup>, counted from Upa Pad, will make one
look ugly. Mixed will be the effects, if there are mixed
Grahas.</p>

<h2><a name=31>Ch. 31. Argala, or Intervention from Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have told of auspicious effects,
related to Argala. Kindly narrate its conditions and
effects.</p>

<p>2-9. Formation of Argala. Maitreya, I explain below Argala to
know the definite effects of Bhavas and Grahas. Grahas in the
4<sup>th</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> cause
Argalas, while obstructors of the Argala will be those in the
10<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> from a
Bhava, or a Grah. If the Argala causing Grah is stronger than
the obstructing one, the former will prevail. Or, if the number
of Argalas are more than the obstructing Grahas, then also the
Argala will prevail. If there are 3, or more malefics in the
3<sup>rd</sup> they will cause Vipreet Argala (more effective
intervention), which will also be harmless and be very
favourable. The 5<sup>th</sup> is also an Argala place, while
the Grah in the 9<sup>th</sup> will counteract such Argala. As
Rahu and Ketu have retrograde motions, the Argalas and
obstructions be also counted accordingly in a reverse manner.
Maharishis say, that the Argala, caused by one Grah, will yield
limited effect, by two medium and by more than two, excellent
effects.  Argalas should be counted from a R&#257;&#347;i, or a
Grah, as the case may be.  The Argala, which is unobstructed
will be fruitful, while the one duly obstructed will go astray.
The Argala effects will be derived in the Dasha periods of the
R&#257;&#347;i, or Grah concerned.</p>

<p>Notes. ‘Argala’ in Sanskrit is figuratively used to denote an
impediment, or obstruction. Some suggest, that the Argala
obstruction places are countable from the Argala place instead
of from the original place, or Grah. This is not logical and a
glance into Gochar Vedha (obstructions during transits) will
confirm our findings.</p>

<p>10. Special. The Argala, caused by placement of a Grah in the
first one fourth part of the R&#257;&#347;i, is countered by
another, placed in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of the respective
obstructive R&#257;&#347;i. Similarly 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter’s
Argala is eliminated by the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter placement of
another Grah.</p>

<p>Notes. If the Argala causing Grah and the obstructing Grah
are in the respective quarters, the obstruction will come to
pass. Otherwise not.</p>

<p>11-17. Argala Effects. Should there be Argala for the Arudh
Pad, for the natal Lagn and for the 7<sup>th</sup> from both,
the native will be famous and fortunate. A malefic, or a
benefic, causing unobstructed Argala, giving a Drishti to Lagn
will make one famous. Similarly a malefic, or a benefic, causing
unobstructed Argala, giving a Drishti to Dhan Bhava denotes
acquisition of wealth and grains, to Sahaj Bhava happiness from
co-born, to Bandhu Bhava residences, quadrupeds and relatives,
to Putr Bhava sons, grand sons and intelligence, to Ari Bhava
fear from enemies, to Yuvati Bhava abundant wealth and marital
happiness, to Randhr Bhava difficulties, to Dharm Bhava
fortunes, to Karm Bhava royal honour, to Labh Bhava gains and to
Vyaya Bhava expenses. The Argala by benefics will give various
kinds of happiness, while benefic effects will be meddling with
malefic Argalas. Argala by both benefics and malefics will yield
results.</p>

<p>Notes. 1. Argala can be caused by a benefic, which is known,
as Subh Argala. This Argala can be from a malefic also, so that
the benefic, causing Argala, stalls the malefic role. If the
benefic’s Argala is obstructed by another, then the benefic will
become ineffective in Argala and the first-mentioned malefic
will operate freely.</p>

<p>2. Argala can be by a malefic with reference to a benefic, so
that the native does not enjoy good effects, due to the benefic.
This is Pap (malefic) Argala. If the Argala is eliminated by a
benefic, or a malefic, then the first mentioned benefic will be
at liberty to act, according to his own disposition.</p>

<p>18. Should there be (unobstructed) Argala for Lagn, Putr and
Dharm Bhava, the native will doubtlessly become a king and
fortunate.</p>

<h2><a name=32>Ch. 32. Karakatwas of the Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. I now detail below Atma Karak etc., obtainable from
among the 7 Grahas, viz. S&#363;rya to &#346;ani. Some say, that
Rahu will become a Karak, when there is a state of similarity in
terms of longitude between (two) Grahas. Yet some say, that the
8 Grahas, including Rahu, will have to be considered
irrespective of such a state.</p>

<p>3-8. Atma Karak Defined. Among the Grahas from S&#363;rya
etc. whichever has traversed maximum number of degrees in a
particular R&#257;&#347;i is called Atma Karak. If the degrees
are identical, then the one with more minutes of arc and, if the
minutes are also identical, then the one with higher seconds of
arc, have to be considered. In that case these three are called
Anthya Karak, Madhya Karak and Upakheta. In the case of Rahu
deduct his longitude in that particular R&#257;&#347;i from 30.
The Karakas will have to be decided, as above and, as per
further rules given below. Out of these Karakas, Atma Karak is
the most important and has a prime say on the native, just as
the king is the most famous among the men of his country and is
the head of all affairs and is entitled to arrest and release
men.</p>

<p>9-12. Importance of Atma Karak. O Brahmin, as the minister
cannot go against the king, the other Karakas, viz. Putr Karak,
Amatya Karak etc. cannot predominate over Atma Karak in the
affairs of the native. If the Atma Karak is adverse, other
Karakas cannot give their benefic effects. Similarly, if Atma
Karak is favourable, other Karakas cannot predominate with their
malefic influences.</p>

<p>13-17. Other Karakas. The Grah next to Atma Karak in terms of
longitude is called Amatya Karak. Similarly following one
another in terms of longitude are Bhratru Karak, Matru Karak,
Pitru Karak, Putr Karak, Gnati Karak and Stri Karak. These are
Char Karakas, or inconstant significators. Some consider Matru
Karak and Putr Karak, as identical. If two Grahas have the same
longitude, both become the same Karak, in which case there will
be a deficit of one Karak. In that circumstance consider
constant significator in the context of benefic/malefic
influence for the concerned relative.</p>

<p>18-21. Constant Karakatwas. I narrate below the constant
Karakatwas, as related to the Grahas. The stronger among
S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr indicates the father, while the
stronger among Candr and Mangal indicates the mother. Mangal
denotes sister, brother-in-law, younger brother and mother. Budh
rules maternal relative, while Guru indicates paternal grand
father. Husband and sons are, respectively, denoted by &#346;ukr
and &#346;ani. From Ketu note wife, father, mother, parents-in
law and maternal grand father. These are constant
Karakatwas.</p>

<p>22-24. Bhavas Related. These constant significances are
derivable from the Bhavas, counted from the said constant
Karakatwas. The 9<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya denotes father,
the 4<sup>th</sup> from Candr mother, the 3<sup>rd</sup> from
Mangal brothers, the 6<sup>th</sup> from Budh maternal uncle,
the 5<sup>th</sup> from Guru sons, the 7<sup>th</sup> from
&#346;ukr wife and the 8<sup>th</sup> from &#346;ani death. The
learned should consider all these and declare related effects
accordingly.</p>

<p>25-30. Yog Karakas. O Brahmin, I make below a passing
reference to Yog Karakas (mutual co-workers). Grahas become Yog
Karakas, if they are in mutual angles identical with own
R&#257;&#347;is, exaltation R&#257;&#347;is, or friendly
R&#257;&#347;is. In Karm Bhava a Grah will be significantly so.
Grahas simply (not being in friendly, own, or exaltation
R&#257;&#347;is) in Lagn, Bandhu and Yuvati Bhava do not become
such Yog Karakas. Even, if they be placed in other Bhavas, but
with such dignities, as mentioned, shall become Yog Karakas.
With such Grahas even a person of mean birth will become a king
and be affluent. One born of royal scion, then will surely
become a king. Thus the effects be declared, considering the
number of such Grahas and the order the native belongs to.</p>

<p>31-34. Bhava Significance. I now narrate the significance of
the Bhavas. Tanu Bhava denotes the soul (self), Dhan family,
finance, wife etc., Sahaj younger brothers/sisters, Putr progeny
and Yuvati wife. It is also said, that a Grah in Putr becomes a
Karak for wife. The Karakatwas of the Bhava in order are
S&#363;rya, Guru, Mangal, Candr, Guru, Mangal, &#346;ukr,
&#346;ani, Guru, Budh, Guru and &#346;ani.</p>

<p>35-37. O excellent of the Brahmins, after knowing the merits
of Tanu Bhava etc. the good and bad effects can be declared.
Ari, Randhr and Vyaya are Trikas, Dusthan, or malefic Bhavas.
Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh are Upachayas. Dhan, Putr, Randhr and
Labh are Panapharas and Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya are
Apoklimas. Association with Trikas will inflict evils.  Kendras
and Konas (Putr and Dharm) are auspicious Bhavas, the
association with which turns even evil into auspiciousness.</p>

<p>(Also see Ch. 34 for more information)</p>

<h2><a name=33>Ch. 33. Effects of Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;</a></h2>

<p>1. O Brahmin, as laid down by Lord Brahma, I now tell you
about the effects of Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; identical with Mesh
etc. (Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; is the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
occupied by the Atma Karak Grah)</p>

<p>2-8. Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; in Various R&#257;&#347;is. If
Atma Karak happens to be in Mesh Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, there
will be nuisance from rats and cats at all times. A malefic
joining will further increase the nuisance. Should Atma Karak be
in Vrishabh Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, happiness from quadrupeds
will result. Should Atma Karak be in Mithun
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be afflicted by itch etc.
Should Atma Karak be in Kark Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, there will
be fear from water etc. If Atma Karak happens to be in Simh
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, fear will be from tiger etc. If Atma
Karak happens to be in Kanya Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, itch,
corpulence, fire etc. will cause trouble, while, if Atma Karak
is in Tula Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, he will make one a trader and
skilful in making robes etc. Vrischik Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
holding Atma Karak, will bring troubles from snakes etc. and
also affliction to mother’s breasts. There will be falls from
height and conveyances etc., if it is Dhanu
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, that is occupied by Atma Karak. Makar
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; in this respect denotes gains from water
dwelling beings and conch, pearl, coral etc. If it is Kumbh
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, holding Atma Karak, the native will
construct tanks etc.  And in Meen Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; the Atma
Karak will grant final emancipation.  The Drishti of a benefic
will remove evils, while that of a malefic will cause no
good.</p>

<p>9-11. O Brahmin, if there be only benefics in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of Lagn
receives a Drishti from a benefic, the native will undoubtedly
become a king. Should the Kendras/Konas from the
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; be occupied by benefics, devoid of
malefic association, the native will be endowed with wealth and
learning.  The combination of benefic and malefic influence will
in this context yield mixed results. If the Upakheta (UpaGrah,
vide Ch.32 Sloka 5) is in its exaltation, or own, or friendly
R&#257;&#347;i and is devoid of a Drishti from a malefic, the
native will go to heaven after death.</p>

<p>12. If the Atma Karak is in the divisions of Candr, Mangal,
or &#346;ukr, the native will go to others wives.  Otherwise the
contrary will prevail.</p>

<p>13-18. Effects of Grahas in the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. O
Brahmin, if S&#363;rya is in the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the
native will be engaged in royal assignments. If the full Candr
is there, he will enjoy pleasures and be a scholar, more so, if
&#346;ukr gives a Drishti to the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If
strong Mangal is in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, he will use the
weapon spear, will live through fire and be an alchemist. Should
strong Budh be Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, he will be skilful in
arts and trading, be intelligent and educated. Guru in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes one, doing good acts, endowed
with spiritualism and Vedic learning. One will be endowed with a
longevity of 100 years, be sensuous and will look after state
affairs, if &#346;ukr is in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. &#346;ani
in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will give such livelihood, as due to
the natives family. Rahu in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes a
thief, a bowman, a machinery maker and a doctor, treating
poisonous afflictions. If Ketu be in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;,
one will deal in elephants and be a thief.</p>

<p>19-22. Rahu-S&#363;rya in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. Should
Rahu and S&#363;rya be in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, there will be
fear from snakes. If a benefic gives a Drishti to
Rahu-S&#363;rya in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, there will be no
fear, but a malefic Drishti will bring death (through serpents).
If Rahu and S&#363;rya occupy benefic Shad Vargas, being in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, one will be a doctor, treating
poisonous afflictions, while the Drishti from Mangal on
Rahu-S&#363;rya in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes, that the
native will burn either his own house, or that of others. Budh’s
Drishti on Rahu-S&#363;rya in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will not
cause the burning of one’s own house, but that of others. If
Rahu and S&#363;rya happen to be in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and
are in a malefic’s R&#257;&#347;i, receiving a Drishti from
Guru, one will burn a house in one’s neighbourhood, while the
Drishti of &#346;ukr will not cause such an event.</p>

<p>23-24. Gulik in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;.  Should the full
Candr give a Drishti to Gulik, placed in the
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will lose his wealth to
thieves, or will himself be a thief. If Gulik is in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, but does not receive a Drishti from
others, one will administer poison to others, or will himself
die of poisoning. Budh’s Drishti in this context will give large
testicles.</p>

<p>25-29. Effects of Drishtis on Ketu in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If Ketu is in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;,
receiving a Drishti from a malefic, ones ears will be severed,
or one will suffer from diseases of the ears. &#346;ukr, giving
a Drishti to Ketu in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, denotes one,
initiated into religious order. One will be devoid of strength,
if Budh and &#346;ani give a Drishti to Ketu in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If Budh and &#346;ukr give a Drishti to
Ketu in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, one will be the son of a female
slave, or of a female remarried. With &#346;ani’s Drishti on
Ketu in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; one will perform penance, or be
a servant, or will be a pseudo-ascetic. &#346;ukr and S&#363;rya
together, giving a Drishti to Ketu in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;,
will make one serve the king. Thus, o Brahmin, are told briefly
the effects of Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>30-31. Effects of the 2<sup>nd</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 2<sup>nd</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; falls in the divisions of &#346;ukr, or
Mangal, one will be addicted to others’ wives and, if &#346;ukr,
or Mangal give a Drishti to the 2<sup>nd</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the tendency will last till death. If
Ketu is the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; in a
division of &#346;ukr, or Mangal, addiction to other’s wives
will not prevail, while the position of Guru will cause such an
evil. Rahu in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;
will destroy wealth.</p>

<p>32. Effects of the 3<sup>rd</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. A malefic in the 3<sup>rd</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one valorous, while a benefic
in the 3<sup>rd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one
timid.</p>

<p>33-35. Effects of the 4<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 4<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; happens to be occupied by &#346;ukr and
Candr, one will own large buildings, like palaces etc. Similar
is the effect of an exalted Grah in the said 4<sup>th</sup>.  A
house, made of stones, is denoted by the occupation of the
4<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; by Rahu and
&#346;ani. Mangal and Ketu in the 4<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; indicate a house, made of bricks, while
Guru in the 4<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes
a house, made of wood. S&#363;rya in the 4<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will give a house of grass. If Candr is
in the 4<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, one will
have union with his wife in an uncompounded house.</p>

<p>36-40. Effects of the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If Rahu and Mangal are in the
5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, one will suffer
from a pulmonary consumption, more so, if Candr gives them a
Drishti. The Drishti of Mangal on the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will bring boils, or ulcers, Ketu’s
Drishti on the 5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will
cause dysentery and other diseases, caused by (impure) water. If
Rahu and Gulik happen to be in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, there will be fear from mean people and
poison.  Should Budh be in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be an ascetic of the
highest order, or one, holding staff. S&#363;rya in the
5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes one, using a
knife.  Mangal in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes one, using a spear. &#346;ani
denotes a bowman, if &#346;ani is placed in the 5<sup>th</sup>
from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. Rahu in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes a machinist. Ketu in the
5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes a watch
maker. &#346;ukr in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one a poet and an eloquent
speaker.</p>

<p>41-45. Effects of Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and the
5<sup>th</sup> from there. If Guru and Candr are in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or the 5<sup>th</sup> thereof, the
native will be an author. &#346;ukr will make one an ordinary
writer, while Budh will indicate, that the writing skills are
less than those of an ordinary writer. Should Guru be alone, one
will be a knower of everything, be a writer and be versed in
Vedas and Vedanta philosophy, but not an oratorian, or a
grammarian.  Mangal denotes a logician, Budh a Mimamsaka
(follower of Karma Mimansa), &#346;ani indicates, that one is
dull-witted in the assembly, S&#363;rya denotes, that one is a
musician, Candr denotes a follower of Sankhya philosophy (of
Maharishi Kapila, who enumerated 25 true principles with
emphasis on final bliss) and indicates, that one is versed in
rhetorics and singing and Ketu, or Rahu denotes, that one is a
Jyotishi. Should Guru be related to the positions of
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or the 5<sup>th</sup> from there, while
the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; is caused by others than him, the
effects, as stated, will effectively come to pass. Some say,
that the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; should also
be similarly considered.</p>

<p>46. Effects of the 6<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 6<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; is occupied by a malefic, the native
will be an agriculturist, while he will be indolent, if a
benefic is in the 6<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;.
The 3<sup>rd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; should also be
similarly considered.</p>

<p>47-48. Effects of the 7<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If Candr and Guru are in the
7<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will
beget a very beautiful wife. &#346;ukr in the 7<sup>th</sup>
form Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes a sensuous wife, while Budh
in the 7<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; indicates a
wife, versed in arts. S&#363;rya in the 7<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will give a wife, who will be confining
domestic core, while &#346;ani in the 7<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; denotes a wife of a higher age bracket,
or a pious and/or sick wife. Rahu in the 7<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will bring a widow in marriage.</p>

<p>49. Effects of the 8<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If a benefic, or the Grah, owning the
8<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, happens to be in
the 8<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will
be long-lived, while a malefic, placed in the 8<sup>th</sup>
from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, will reduce the life span.
Drishti/Yuti of both benefics and malefics will yield a medium
span of life.</p>

<p>50-56. Effects of the 9<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 9<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; receives a Drishti from, or is occupied
by a benefic, the native will be truthful, devoted to elders and
attached to his own religion. If a malefic gives a Drishti to,
or occupies the 9<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, one
will be attached to his religion in boyhood, but will take to
falsehood in old age. If &#346;ani and Rahu, one will betray his
elders and be adverse to ancient learning. If Guru and
S&#363;rya, one will betray his elders and will be disobedient
to them. Should Mangal and &#346;ukr give a Drishti to, or
occupy the 9<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and are
joining in six identical Vargas, a female, ill-related to the
native, will die. Budh and Candr giving a Drishti to, or
occupying the 9<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and
joining in six identical Vargas will cause imprisonment of the
native, due to association with a female not of his own. If Guru
is alone, related to the 9<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; by Drishti, or by Yuti, the native will
be addicted to females and be devoted to sensual enjoyments.</p>

<p>57-60. Effects of the 10<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 10<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; receives a Drishti from, or is conjoined
by a benefic, the native will have firm riches, be sagacious,
strong and intelligent. A malefic, giving a Drishti to the
10<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or occupying this
Bhava, will cause harm to his profession and deprive him of
paternal bliss. Budh and &#346;ukr, giving a Drishti to the
10<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or conjoining this
Bhava, will confer many gains in business and will make him do
many great deeds. S&#363;rya and Candr, giving a Drishti to the
10<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or conjoining this
place and receiving a Drishti from, or be in Yuti with Guru, the
native will acquire a kingdom.</p>

<p>61-62. Effects of the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 11<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with
a benefic, the native will enjoy happiness from co-born apart
from gaining in every undertaking of his. If a malefic is in the
11<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will
gain by questionable means, be famous and valorous.</p>

<p>63-74. Effects of the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. If the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; has a benefic, the expenses will be on
good account, while a malefic in the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will cause bad expenses. If the
12<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; is vacant, then
also good effects will follow. If there happens to be a benefic
Grah in exaltation, or in own Bhava in the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or, if Ketu is so placed and receives a
Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, one will attain heaven
after death. One will attain full enlightenment, if Ketu is in
the 12<sup>th</sup> identical with Mesh, or Dhanu and receives a
Drishti from a benefic. If Ketu is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, or
is there yuti with a malefic, one will not attain full
enlightenment. If S&#363;rya and Ketu are in the 12<sup>th</sup>
from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will worship Lord
Shiva. Candr and Ketu denotes a worshiper of Gauri. &#346;ukr
and Ketu of Lakshmi and a wealthy person. Mangal and Ketu of
Lord Subramanya.  Rahu will make one worship Durga, or some mean
deity. Ketu alone denotes Subramanya’s, or Ganesh’s worshipper.
If &#346;ani is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; in a malefic’s R&#257;&#347;i, one will
worship mean deities. &#346;ukr and &#346;ani in the
12<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; in a malefic’s
R&#257;&#347;i will also make one worship mean deities. Similar
inferences can be drawn from the 6<sup>th</sup>
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, counted from Amatya Karak’s
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>75-76. Miscellaneous Matters (up to Sloka 84). O Brahmin, if
there are two malefics in a Kon from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;,
the native will have knowledge of Mantras and Tantras (formulas
for the attainment of super-human powers). If a malefic
simultaneously gives a Drishti to two malefics in a Kon from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will use his learnings of
Mantras and Tantras for malevolent purposes, while a benefic’s
Drishti will make him use the learnings for public good.</p>

<p>77-84&frac12;. If Candr is in the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;,
receiving a Drishti from &#346;ukr, the native will be an
alchemist and, if receiving a Drishti from Budh the native will
be a doctor capable of curing all diseases. If Candr is in the
4<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; and receives a
Drishti from &#346;ukr, the native will be afflicted by white
leprosy. If receiving a Drishti from Mangal, the native will
have blood and bilious disorders and, if receiving a Drishti
from Ketu, the native will suffer from black leprosy. Should
Rahu and Mangal be in the 4<sup>th</sup>, or 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will suffer from pulmonary
consumption and, if simultaneously there happens to be Candr’s
Drishti on the 4<sup>th</sup>, or the 5<sup>th</sup>, this
affliction will be certain. Mangal alone in the 4<sup>th</sup>,
or the 5<sup>th</sup> will cause ulcers. If Ketu is in the
4<sup>th</sup>, or the 5<sup>th</sup>, one will suffer from
dysentery and afflictions, due to (impure) water. Rahu and Gulik
will make one a doctor, curing poisonous afflictions, or will
cause troubles through poison. Should &#346;ani be alone in the
4<sup>th</sup>, or 5<sup>th</sup>, the native will be skillful
in archery. Ketu lonely placed in the 4<sup>th</sup>, or the
5<sup>th</sup> will make one a maker of watches etc. Budh lonely
placed in the 4<sup>th</sup>, or the 5<sup>th</sup> will make
one an ascetic of the highest order, or an ascetic, holding
staff. Rahu, S&#363;rya and Mangal, respectively, in these
places denote a machinist, a knife user and a spear, or arrow
user.</p>

<p>85-86. Candr and Guru in the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in
the 5<sup>th</sup> therefrom denotes a writer well versed in all
branches of learning. The grade of writership will comparatively
descend in the case of &#346;ukr and even further in the case of
Budh.</p>

<p>87-92&frac12;. Grahas in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. Should &#346;ukr be in the
5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be
eloquent and a poet. Guru denotes, that he be an exponent and be
all knowing, but be unable to speak in an assembly. He will be
further a grammarian and a scholar in Vedas and Upanishads.
&#346;ani will make one ineffective in an assembly, while Budh
will make him skilful in Karma Mimansa. Mangal in
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or the 5<sup>th</sup> therefrom will
make one justice, while Candr in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or the
5<sup>th</sup> from there denotes a Sankhya Yogi, a rhetoric, or
a singer. S&#363;rya in the 5<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one learned in Vedanta and
music. Ketu will make one a mathematician and skilful in
Jyotish. Should Guru be related to the said Ketu, these
learnings will be by inheritance. All these as well apply to
2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;
and to the Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; itself apart from applying to
the 5<sup>th</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>93-93&frac12;. Should Ketu be in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, or
3<sup>rd</sup> from Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be
defective in speech, more so, if a malefic gives a Drishti to
Ketu, as above.</p>

<p>94-99. If malefics be in Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, Arudh Lagn
and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> from these places,
there will be Kemadrum Yog, the effects of which will be still
severer, if Candr’s Drishti happens to be there. The effects,
due for these Yogas, will come to pass in the Dasha periods of
the R&#257;&#347;is, or Grahas concerned. Kemadrum Yog will
operate additionally, if there are malefics in the
2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> from the R&#257;&#347;i, whose
Dasha will be in currency. The results of such Yog will also be
inauspicious. If the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> in the
Kundali, cast for the beginning of a Dasha, have malefics, then
also Kemadrum prevails throughout the Dasha.</p>

<h2><a name=34>Ch. 34. Yoga Karakas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Brahmin, thus I have told you about the effects,
derivable through Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;. Now listen to the
effects, arising out of lordships of Grahas over Bhavas.</p>

<p>2-7. Nature due to Lordships of Grahas.  Benefics, owning
Kendras, will not give benefic effects, while malefics, owning
Kendras, will not remain inauspicious. The Lord of a Kon will
give auspicious results. The Lord of Lagn is specially
auspicious, as Lagn is a Kendr, as well as a Kon. Putr and Dharm
Bhava are specially for wealth, while Yuvati and Karm Bhava are
specially for happiness. Any Grah, owning Sahaj, Ari, or Labh
Bhava, will give evil effects. The effects, due to the Lords of
Vyaya and Randhr Bhava, will depend on their association. In
each group the significance will be in the ascending order.
Randhr’s Lord is not auspicious, as he owns the 12<sup>th</sup>
from Dharm Bhava. If the Lord of Randhr Bhava simultaneously
owns Sahaj, Yuvati, or Labh Bhava, he will prove specifically
harmful, while his simultaneous ownership of a Kon will bestow
auspicious effects. The Grah, owning a predominant Bhava, will
stall the effects, due to another, owning a less significant
Bhava and will give his own results. Randhr’s lordship of
S&#363;rya and Candr is not evil.</p>

<p>8-10. Natural Benefics and Malefics. Guru and &#346;ukr are
benefics, while Candr is mediocre in benefice and Budh is
neutral (a benefic, when associated with a benefic and a
malefic, when related to a malefic). Malefics are S&#363;rya,
&#346;ani and Mangal. Full Candr, Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr are
stronger in the ascending order. Weak Candr, S&#363;rya,
&#346;ani and Mangal are stronger (in malefic disposition) in
the ascending order. In revealing maleficence, due to rulership
of Kendras, Candr, Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr are significant in
the ascending order.</p>

<p>11-12. Lordships of Kendras and Konas. If there be an
exchange between a Lord of a Kendr and a Lord of a Kon, or, if a
Lord of a Kendr is yuti with a Lord of a Kon in a Kendr, or in a
Kon, or, if a Lord of a Kon is in a Kendr, or vice versa, or, if
there happens to be a full Drishti between a Lord of a Kendr and
a Lord of a Kon, they cause a Yog. One born in such a Yog will
become a king and be famous.</p>

<p>13. If one and the same Grah gets the lordships of a Kon, as
well as a Kendr, or, if a Grah is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, it
will prove specially a Yog Karak.</p>

<p>14. Lordship of Kendr. It has been said, that a malefic,
owning a Kendr, will become auspicious, which is true, only when
it simultaneously Lords over a Kon and not by merely owning a
Kendr.</p>

<p>15. If the Lords of a Kendr, or a Kon own simultaneously an
evil Bhava, he does not cause a Raj Yog by mere relations
stipulated (as per Ch. 34, Slokas 11 and 12).</p>

<p>16. Rahu and Ketu. Rahu and Ketu give predominantly the
effects, as due to their yuti with a Bhava Lord, or, as due to
the Bhava they occupy.</p>

<p>17. If Rahu and/or Ketu are in Kendr, receiving a Drishti
from, or in association with the Lord of a Kon, or of a Kendr,
it will become Yog Karak.</p>

<p>18. O Maharishi Parashar, please narrate, according to the
R&#257;&#347;is rising, as to which Grah is a Yog Karak and
which is inauspicious.</p>

<p>19-22. Grahas and Mesh Lagn. O Brahmin, listen to these with
examples. Even though Mangal is the Lord of Randhr Bhava, he
will be helpful to auspicious Grahas. &#346;ani, Budh and
&#346;ukr are malefics. Auspicious are Guru and S&#363;rya. The
mere Yuti of &#346;ani with Guru will not produce auspicious
effects (although they own a Kon and a Kendr). If Guru is at the
disposal of a malefic, he will surely give inauspicious results.
&#346;ukr is a direct (independent) killer. &#346;ani etc. will
also inflict death, if associated with an adverse Grah
(&#346;ukr).</p>

<p>23-24. Grahas and Vrishabh Lagn. Guru, &#346;ukr and Candr
are malefics. &#346;ani and S&#363;rya are auspicious.
&#346;ani will cause Raj Yog. Budh is somewhat inauspicious. The
Guru group (Guru, Candr and &#346;ukr) and Mangal will inflict
death.</p>

<p>25-26. Grahas and Mithun Lagn.  Mangal, Guru and S&#363;rya
are malefics, while &#346;ukr is the only auspicious Grah. The
Yuti of Guru with &#346;ani is similar to that for Mesh Lagn.
Candr is the prime killer, but it is dependant on her
association.</p>

<p>27-28. Grahas and Kark Lagn. &#346;ukr and Budh are malefics,
Mangal, Guru and Candr are auspicious. Mangal is capable of
conferring a full-fledged Yog and giving auspicious effects.
&#346;ani and S&#363;rya are killers and give effects, according
to their associations.</p>

<p>29-30. Grahas and Simh Lagn. Budh, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani
are malefics. Auspicious effects will be given by Mangal, Guru
and S&#363;rya. Guru’s Yuti with &#346;ukr (though,
respectively, Kon and Kendr Lords) will not produce auspicious
results.  &#346;ani and Candr are killers, who will give
effects, according to their associations.</p>

<p>31-32. Grahas and Kanya Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Candr are
malefics, while Budh and &#346;ukr are auspicious.  &#346;ukr’s
Yuti with Budh will produce Yog. &#346;ukr is a killer as well.
S&#363;rya’s role will depend on his association.</p>

<p>33-34. Grahas and Tula Lagn. Guru, S&#363;rya and Mangal are
malefics. Auspicious are &#346;ani and Budh.  Candr and Budh
will cause Raj Yog. Mangal is a killer. Guru and other malefics
will also acquire a disposition to inflict death. &#346;ukr is
neutral.</p>

<p>35-36. Grahas and Vrischik Lagn. &#346;ukr, Budh and
&#346;ani are malefics. Guru and Candr are auspicious.
S&#363;rya, as well as Candr are Yog Karakas. Mangal is neutral.
&#346;ukr and other malefics acquire the quality of causing
death.</p>

<p>37-38. Grahas and Dhanu Lagn. Only &#346;ukr is inauspicious.
Mangal and S&#363;rya are auspicious.  S&#363;rya and Budh are
capable of conferring a Yog. &#346;ani is a killer, Guru is
neutral. &#346;ukr acquires killing powers.</p>

<p>39-40. Grahas and Makar Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Candr are
malefics, &#346;ukr and Budh are auspicious. &#346;ani will not
be a killer on his own. Mangal and other malefics will inflict
death.  S&#363;rya is neutral. Only &#346;ukr is capable of
causing a superior Yog.</p>

<p>41-42. Grahas and Kumbh Lagn. Guru, Candr and Mangal are
malefics, while &#346;ukr and &#346;ani are auspicious.
&#346;ukr is the only Grah, that causes Raj Yog. Guru,
S&#363;rya and Mangal are killers. Budh gives meddling
effects.</p>

<p>43-44. Grahas and Meen Bhava. &#346;ani, &#346;ukr,
S&#363;rya and Budh are malefics. Mangal and Candr are
auspicious. Mangal and Guru will cause a Yog. Though Mangal is a
killer, he will not kill the native (independently). &#346;ani
and Budh are killers.</p>

<p>45-46. General. Thus the auspicious and inauspicious effects,
derivable through the Grahas, due to their lordship, according
to the rising R&#257;&#347;i, have to be estimated. Apart the
effects, due to Nabhash Yogas etc., should also be known, which
I narrate, as under.</p>

<h2><a name=35>Ch. 35. Nabhash Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. O excellent of the Brahmins, explained below are 32
Nabhash Yogas, which have a total of 1800 different varieties.
These consist of 3 Asraya Yogas, 2 Dala Yogas, 20 Akriti Yogas
and 7 Sankhya Yogas.</p>

<p>3-6. Names of Nabhash Yogas. The 3 Asraya Yogas are Rajju,
Musala and Nala Yogas. The 2 Dala Yogas are Maal and Sarpa.  The
20 Akriti Yogas are Gada, Sakat, Shringatak, Vihag, Hal, Vajr,
Kamal, Vapi, Yup, Shar, Shakti, Danda, Nisk, Koot, Chatr,
Dhanushi (Chap), Ardh, Candr, Chakr and Samudr Yogas. The 7
Sankhya Yogas are Vallaki, Daam, Paash, Kedara, Sool, Yuga and
Gola Yogas. Thus these are 32 in total.</p>

<p>7. Rajju, Musala and Nala Yogas. All the Grahas in Movable
R&#257;&#347;is cause Rajju Yog. All the Grahas in Fixed
R&#257;&#347;is cause Musala Yog. All the Grahas in Dual
R&#257;&#347;is cause Nala Yog.</p>

<p>8. Maal and Sarpa Yogas. If 3 Kendras are occupied by
benefics, Maal Yog is produced, while malefics so placed will
cause Bhujang, or Sarpa Yog. These Yogas, respectively, produce
benefic and malefic results.</p>

<p>9-11. Gada, Sakat, Vihag, Shringatak, Hal, Vajr and Yav
Yogas. If all the Grahas occupy two successive Kendras, Gada Yog
is formed. Sakat Yog occurs, when all the Grahas are disposed in
Lagn and Yuvati Bhava. If all confine to Bandhu and Karm Bhava,
then Vihag Yog occurs.  All Grahas in Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava
cause Shringatak Yog, while all Grahas in Dhan, Ari and Karm
Bhava, or in Sahaj, Yuvati and Labh Bhava, or in Bandhu, Randhr
and Vyaya Bhava cause Hal Yog. Vajr Yog is caused by all
benefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, or all malefics in Bandhu and
Karm Bhava. In a contrary situation, i.e. all benefics in Bandhu
and Karm Bhava, or all malefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, Yav
Yog is generated.</p>

<p>12. Kamal and Vapi Yogas. If all the Grahas are in the 4
Kendras, Kamal Yog is produced. If all of them happen to be in
all the Apoklimas, or in all the Panapharas, Vapi Yog
occurs.</p>

<p>13. Yup, Shar, Shakti and Danda Yogas. If all the 7 Grahas
are in the 4 Bhavas, commencing from Lagn, they cause Yup Yog,
if from Bandhu, Shar Yog occurs, if from Yuvati, Shakti Yog
occurs and, if from Karm, Danda Yog is formed.</p>

<p>14. Nauka, Koot, Chatr and Chap Yogas. If all the Grahas
occupy the seven Bhavas from Lagn, Nauka Yog occurs, if from
Bandhu, Koot Yog is formed, if from Yuvati, Chatr Yog occurs
and, if from Karm, Chap Yog occurs. Here again the Grahas should
occupy seven continuous Bhavas.</p>

<p>Quoted from Saravali. If the seven Grahas occupy continuously
seven Bhavas, commencing from a Bhava, which is not angular to
the Lagna, the Yoga produced is known, as Ardh Candra Yoga.</p>

<p>15. Chakr and Samudr Yogas. If all the Grahas occupy six
alternative R&#257;&#347;is, commencing from Lagn, Chakr Yog is
formed. Samudr Yog is produced, if all Grahas occupy six
alternative R&#257;&#347;is, commencing from Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>16-17. Sankhya Yogas. If all Grahas are in one
R&#257;&#347;i, Gola Yog is formed, if in 2, Yuga Yog is formed,
if in 3, Sool Yog occurs, if in 4, Kedara Yog occurs, if in 5,
Paash Yog is formed, if in 6, Daam Yog occurs and, if in 7,
Veena Yog is produced. None of these seven Yogas will be
operable, if another Nabhash Yog is derivable.</p>

<h2><a name=36>Ch. 36. Many Other Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Benefic and Malefic Yogas. If there be a benefic in
Lagn, Subh Yog is produced, while a malefic in Lagn causes Asubh
Yog. Benefics in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Subh Yog.
Malefics in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Asubh Yog. One born
in Subh Yog will be eloquent, charming and virtuous, while his
counterpart will be sensuous, will do sinful acts and will enjoy
(swallow) others’ wealth.</p>

<p>3-4. Gaj Kesari Yog. Should Guru be in a Kendr from Lagn, or
from Candr and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from
benefic, avoiding at the same time debilitation, combustion and
inimical R&#257;&#347;i, Gaj Kesari Yog is caused. One born in
Gaj Kesari Yog will be splendourous, wealthy, intelligent,
endowed with many laudable virtues and will please the king.</p>

<p>5-6. Amal Yog. If there be exclusively a benefic in the
10<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, or Candr, Amal Yog exists. Amal Yog
will confer fame, lasting till Candr and stars exist and will
make the native honoured by the king, enjoy abundant pleasures,
charitable, fond of relatives, helpful to others, pious and
virtuous.</p>

<p>7-8. Parvat Yog. Benefics in Kendras will produce Parvat Yog,

benefics. One born in Parvat Yog will be wealthy, eloquent,
charitable, learned in Shastras, fond of mirth, famous,
splendourous and be the leader of a city.</p>

<p>9-10. Kahal Yog. Should Bandhu’s Lord and Guru be in mutual
Kendras, while Lagn’s Lord is strong, Kahal Yog occurs.
Alternatively Bandhu’s Lord, being in his own, or exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, should be yuti with Karm’s Lord. In effect the
native will be energetic, adventurous, charming, endowed with a
complete Army, consisting of chariots, elephants, horses and
infantry and he will Lord over a few villages.</p>

<p>11-12. Chamar Yog. If Lagn’s Lord is exalted in a Kendr and
receives a Drishti from Guru, Chamar Yog is formed. This Yog
also occurs, if two benefics are in Lagn, or Dharm, or Karm, or
Yuvati Bhava. The effects of Chamar Yog are: the native will be
a king, or honoured by the king, long lived, scholarly, eloquent
and versed in all arts.</p>

<p>13-14. Shankh Yog. If Lagn’s Lord is strong, while the Lords
of Putr and Ari Bhava are in mutual Kendras, then what is known,
as Shankh Yog, is produced. Alternatively, if Lagn’s Lord along
with Karm’s Lord is in a Movable R&#257;&#347;i, while Dharm’s
Lord is strong, Shankh Yog is obtained. One born with Shankh Yog
will be endowed with wealth, spouse and sons. He will be kindly
disposed, propitious, intelligent, meritorious and
long-lived.</p>

<p>15-16. Bhairi Yog. If Vyaya, Tanu, Dhan and Yuvati Bhava are
occupied, as Dharm’s Lord is strong, the native obtains Bhairi
Yog. Again another kind of Bhairi Yog is formed, if &#346;ukr,
Guru and Lagn’s Lord are in a Kendr, while Dharm’s Lord is
strong. The results of Bhairi Yog are: the native will be
endowed with wealth, wife and sons. He will be a king, be
famous, virtuous and endowed with good behaviour, happiness and
pleasures.</p>

<p>17. Mridang Yog. If Lagn’s Lord is strong and others occupy

Devendra (god of gods).</p>

<p>19-20. Sharad Yog. Should Karm’s Lord be in Putr Bhava, while
Budh is in a Kendr, as S&#363;rya with strength is in Simh,
Sharad Yog is formed. This will again be obtained, if Guru, or
Budh is in a Kon to Candr, while Mangal is in Labh Bhava. One
born in either kind of Yog will obtain wealth, spouse and sons,
be happy, scholarly, dear to the king, pious and virtuous.</p>

<p>21-22. Matsya Yog. Benefics in Dharm and Tanu Bhava, mixed
Grahas in Putr Bhava and malefics in Bandhu and Randhr Bhava:
this array of Grahas at birth will produce Matsya Yog. In effect
the native will be a Jyotishi, be a synonym of kindness, be
virtuous, strong, beautiful, famous, learned and pious.</p>

<p>23-24. Kurm Yog. If Putr, Ari and Yuvati Bhava are occupied
by benefic Grahas identical with own Bhava, or exaltation, or
friendly R&#257;&#347;i, while malefics are in Sahaj, Labh and
Tanu Bhava, in own Bhava, or in exaltation, Kurm Yog is formed.
The results of Kurm Yog are: the native will be a king. be
courageous, virtuous, famous, helpful, happy. He will be a
leader of men.</p>

<p>25-26. Khadg Yog. Should there be an exchange of
R&#257;&#347;is between the Lords of Dhan and Dharm Bhava, as
Lagn’s Lord is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, Khadg Yog is obtained.
One with Khadg Yog will be endowed with wealth, fortunes and
happiness, be learned in Shastras, be intelligent, mighty,
grateful and skilful.</p>

<p>27-28. Lakshmi Yog. If Dharm’s Lord is in a Kendr identical
with his Mooltrikon R&#257;&#347;i, or own R&#257;&#347;i, or in
exaltation, while Lagn’s Lord is endowed with strength, Lakshmi
Yog occurs.  The native with Lakshmi Yog will be charming,
virtuous, kingly in status, endowed with many sons and abundant
wealth. He will be famous and of high moral merits.</p>

<p>29-30. Kusum Yog. &#346;ukr in a Kendr, Candr in a Kon along
with a benefic and &#346;ani in Karm Bhava: these Grahas thus
cause Kusum Yog for one born in a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i
ascending. Such a native will be a king, or equal to him, be
charitable, will enjoy pleasures, be happy, prime among his race
men, virtuous and red-lettered.</p>

<p>31-32. Kalanidhi Yog. If Guru is placed in Dhan, or Putr
Bhava and receives a Drishti from Budh and &#346;ukr, Kalanidhi
Yog is caused. In effect the native will be virtuous, honoured
by the kings, bereft of diseases, be happy, wealthy and
learned.</p>

<p>33-34. Kalpa Drum Yog. Note the following four Grahas: Lagn’s
Lord , the dispositor of Lagn’s Lord (a), the dispositor of the
Grah “a” (b), the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; dispositor of the Grah
“b”. If all these are disposed in Kendras and in Konas from
Lagn, or are exalted, Kalpa Drum Yog exists. One with Kalpa Drum
Yog will be endowed with all kinds of wealth, be a king, pious,
strong, fond of war and merciful.</p>

<p>35-36. Trimurthi Yogas. Counted from Dhan’s Lord, if benefics
occupy the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>,
Hari Yog is formed. If the 4<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup> with reference to the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by
Yuvati’s Lord, are occupied by benefics, Hara Yog is obtainable.
Brahma Yog is generated, if, counted from Lagn’s Lord, benefics
are in the 4<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>
R&#257;&#347;is. One born in anyone of the said three Yogas will
be happy, learned and endowed with wealth and sons.</p>

<p>37. Lagn Adhi Yog. Should benefics be in Yuvati and Randhr
Bhava, counted from Lagn and be devoid of Yuti with and/or
Drishti from malefics, Lagn Adhi Yog is produced, making one a
great person, learned in Shastras and happy.</p>

<p>38-39. Effects of Lagn’s Lord’s Division Dignities. Lagn’s
Lord in Parijat&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one happy, in
Vargottama will give immunity to diseases, in
Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one rich with wealth and
grains, in Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one a king, in
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one a scholar, in
Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one opulent and endowed with
conveyances and in Iravat&#257;&#324;&#347; will make one famous
and honoured by kings.  (Vargottama indicates a Grah, occupying
the same R&#257;&#347;i and the same Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;)</p>

<h2><a name=37>Ch. 37. Candr’s Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1. If Candr with reference to S&#363;rya is in a Kendr, one’s
wealth, intelligence and skill will be little, if in a
Panaphara, will be meddling, if in a Apoklima, will be
excellent.</p>

<p>2-4. In the case of a day birth, if Candr, placed in its own
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in a friendly Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
receives a Drishti from Guru, one will be endowed with wealth
and happiness. One born at night time will enjoy similar
effects, if Candr is in its own Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in a
friendly Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, receiving a Drishti from
&#346;ukr. In a contrary situation, the Drishti from Guru, or
from &#346;ukr on Candr will make one go with little wealth, or
even without that.</p>

<p>5. Adhi Yog from Candr. If benefics occupy the
8<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>, counted from
Candr, Adhi Yog obtains. According to the strength of the
participating Grahas, the native concerned will be either a
king, or a minister, or an Army chief.</p>

<p>6. Dhan Yog. Should all the (three) benefics be Upachaya,
counted from Candr, one will be very affluent. With two
benefics, placed in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, the 6<sup>th</sup>, the
10<sup>th</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup>, one will have medium
effects in regard to wealth. If a single benefic is there, the
wealth will be negligible.</p>

<p>7-10. Sunaph, Anaph and Duradhar. If there is a Grah other
than S&#363;rya, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from Candr, Sunaph Yog is
formed, if in the 12<sup>th</sup> from Candr, Anaph Yog is
formed and, if in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> from
Candr, Duradhar Yog is caused. One with Sunaph Yog will be a
king, or equal to a king, endowed with intelligence, wealth,
fame and self-earned wealth. One born in Anaph Yog will be a
king, be free from diseases, virtuous, famous, charming and
happy. One born in Duradhar Yog will enjoy pleasures, will be
charitable and endowed with wealth, conveyances and excellent
serving force.</p>

<p>11-13. Kema Drum Yog. Excluding S&#363;rya, should there be
no Grah with Candr, or in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and/or
12<sup>th</sup> from Candr, or in a Kendr from Lagn, Kema Drum
Yog is formed. One born in Kema Drum Yog will be very much
reproached, will be bereft of intelligence, learning, reduced to
penury and perils.</p>

<h2><a name=38>Ch. 38. S&#363;rya’s Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1. Vesi, Vosi and Abhayachari Yogas.  Barring Candr, if a
Grah among Mangal etc. be in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from S&#363;rya,
Vesi Yog is formed, if in the 12<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya,
Vosi Yog is formed and if in both the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the
12<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya, Ubhayachari Yog is caused.</p>

<p>2-3. Effects of Vesi, Vosi and Ubhayachari Yogas. One born in
Vesi Yog will be even sighted, truthful, long-bodied, indolent,
happy and endowed with negligible wealth. One born with Vosi Yog
will be skilful, charitable and endowed with fame, learning and
strength. The Ubhayachari native will be a king, or equal to a
king and be happy.</p>

<p>4. Benefics, causing Vesi, Vosi, or Ubhayachari Yogas, will
give the above-mentioned effects, while malefics will produce
contrary effects.</p>

<h2><a name=39>Ch. 39. Raj Yog</a></h2>

<p>1-2. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now narrate below the Raj
Yogas, making one entitled to royal honour. These were told to
Parvati by Lord Shiva once upon a time, the gist of which is, as
follows.</p>

<p>3-5. Raj Yogas are to be known from the
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn and the natal Lagn. On the one hand
the pair of Atma Karak and Putr Karak should be considered and
on the other hand the natal Lagn’s Lord and Putr’s Lord should
be taken into consideration. The effects, due to such
association, will be full, or a half, or a quarter, according to
their strengths.</p>

<p>6-7. Maha Raj Yog. Should Lagn’s Lord and Putr’s Lord
exchange their R&#257;&#347;is, or, if Atma Karak and Putr Karak
(Char) are in Lagn, or in Putr Bhava, or in the exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, or in own R&#257;&#347;i, or in own
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, receiving a Drishti from a benefic, Maha
Raj Yog is produced. The native so born will be famous and
happy.</p>

<p>8. If Lagn’s Lord and Atma Karak are in Tanu, Putr, or Yuvati
Bhava, yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from a benefic, a Raj
Yog is formed.</p>

<p>9-10. Should there be benefics in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, the
4<sup>th</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup>, counted either from
Lagn’s Lord, or from Atma Karak R&#257;&#347;i, one will become
a king. Similarly malefics in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
6<sup>th</sup> from Lagn’s Lord, or from Atma Karak
R&#257;&#347;i will make one a king.</p>

<p>11. One will be related to royal circles, if &#346;ukr is the
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in the 5<sup>th</sup> there from, or
in Lagn, or in Arudh Lagn, receiving a Drishti from, or yuti
with Guru, or Candr.</p>

<p>12. Even, if a single Grah gives a Drishti to the natal Lagn,
or Hora Lagn, or Ghatik Lagn, the native will become a king.</p>

<p>13-14. If the Shad Vargas of Lagn are occupied, or receive a
Drishti from one and the same Grah, a Raj Yog is doubtlessly
formed. Accordingly, if the Drishti is full, half, or one
fourth, results will be in order full, medium and
negligible.</p>

<p>15. If the 3 Lagnas (natal, Hora and Ghatik) are occupied by
Grahas in exaltation, or in own R&#257;&#347;i, or, if the natal
Lagn, the Dreshkan Lagn and the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn have
exalted Grahas, Raj Yog is formed.</p>

<p>16. If Candr and a benefic are in the Arudh Lang, as Guru is
in the 2<sup>nd</sup> from the natal Lagn and both these places
are receiving Drishtis from Grahas in exaltation, or Grahas in
own R&#257;&#347;i, there will be a Raj Yog.</p>

<p>17. If Lagn, Dhan and Bandhu Bhava are occupied by benefics,
while a malefic is in Sahaj Bhava, one will become a king, or
equal to a king.</p>

<p>18. The native will be wealthy, if one among Candr, Guru,
&#346;ukr and Budh is exalted in Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>19. If Ari, Randhr and Sahaj Bhava are occupied by
debilitated Grahas, as Lagn’s Lord is exalted, or is in own
Bhava and gives a Drishti to Lagn, there is a Raj Yog.</p>

<p>20. Again a Raj Yog is formed, if Ari’s, Randhr’s and Vyaya’s
Lords are in fall, or in inimical R&#257;&#347;is, or in
combustion, as Lagn’s Lord, placed in his own R&#257;&#347;i, or
in its exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, gives a Drishti to Lagn.</p>

<p>21. If Karm’s Lord, placed in his own Bhava, or in its
exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, gives a Drishti to Lagn, a Raj Yog is
formed. Similar is the case, if benefics are in Kendras.</p>

<p>22. If the Atma Karak Grah is in a benefic’s
R&#257;&#347;i/Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be
wealthy. If there are benefics in Kendras from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn, he will become a king.</p>

<p>23. If the Arudh Lagn and Dar Pad are in mutual Kendras, or
in mutual Sahaj/Labh Bhavas, or in mutual Konas, the native will
doubtlessly become a king.</p>

<p>24. If two, or all of Bhava, Hora, Ghatik Lagnas are
receiving a Drishti from exalted Grahas, a Raj Yog is
formed.</p>

<p>25. If Bhava, Hora and Ghatik Lagnas, their Dreshkanas and
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as, or the said Lagnas and their
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as, or the said Lagnas and their Dreshkanas
receive a Drishti from a Grah, a Raj Yog is formed.</p>

<p>26-27. If Arudh Pad is occupied by an exalted Grah,
particularly Candr in exaltation, or by Guru and/or &#346;ukr
(with, or without exaltation), while there is no Argala by a
malefic, the native will become a king. If the Arudh Pad is a
benefic R&#257;&#347;i, containing Candr, while Guru is in Dhan
Bhava, the same effect will prevail.</p>

<p>28. Even, if one among Ari’s, Randhr’s and Vyaya’s Lords,
being in debilitation, gives a Drishti to Lagn, there will be a
Raj Yog.</p>

<p>29-31. The native will become a king, if a Grah, ruling
Bandhu, Karm, Dhan, or Labh, gives a Drishti to Lagn, while
&#346;ukr gives a Drishti to the 11<sup>th</sup> from Arudh
Lagn, as Arudh Lagn is occupied by a benefic. The same effect
will be obtained, if a debilitated Grah gives a Drishti to Lagn
and is placed in Ari, or Randhr Bhava. Again similar result will
prevail, if a debilitated Grah, placed in Sahaj, or Labh Bhava,
gives a Drishti to Lagn.</p>

<p>32. I now tell you of the Raj Yogas, based on the Grahas with
different dignities and on the Drishtis and Yutis of the
Grahas.</p>

<p>33-34. Dharm’s Lord is akin to a minister and more especially
Putr’s Lord. If these two Grahas mutually give a Drishti, the
native will obtain a kingdom. Even, if these two are yuti in any
Bhava, or, if they happen to be placed in mutually
7<sup>th</sup> places, one born of royal scion will become a
king.</p>

<p>35. The native will attain a kingdom, if Bandhu’s Lord is in
Karm Bhava and Karm’s Lord is in Bandhu Bhava and, if these
Grahas give a Drishti to Putr’s and Dharm’s Lords.</p>

<p>36. If the Lords of Putr, Karm, Bandhu and Lagn are yuti in
Dharm Bhava, one will become a ruler with fame, spreading over
the four directions.</p>

<p>37. Should the Lord of Bandhu, or of Karm Bhava join either
the Putr’s Lord, or Dharm’s Lord, the native will obtain a
kingdom.</p>

<p>38. If Putr’s Lord is in Lagn, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava, yuti
with Dharm’s Lord, or Lagn Lord, the native will become a
king.</p>

<p>39. Should Guru be in his own R&#257;&#347;i identical with
Dharm Bhava and yuti with either &#346;ukr, or Putr’s Lord, the
native will obtain royal status.</p>

<p>40. Two and a half Ghatis from mid-day, or from mid-night is
auspicious time. A birth during such an auspicious time will
cause one to be a king, or equal to him.</p>

<p>41. Should Candr and &#346;ukr be mutually in Sahaj and Labh
Bhava and receiving Drishtis from each other, while they are
placed elsewhere, a Raj Yog is obtained.</p>

<p>42. Should Candr, endowed with strength, be
Vargott&#257;&#324;&#347; and receives a Drishti from four, or
more Grahas, the native will become a king.</p>

<p>43. One will become a king, if Lagn in
Uttam&#257;&#324;&#347; receives a Drishti from four, or more
Grahas, out of which Candr should not be one.</p>

<p>44. If one, or two, or three Grahas are in exaltation, one of
a royal scion will become a king, while another will be equal to
a king, or be wealthy.</p>

<p>45. If four, or five Grahas occupy their exaltation
R&#257;&#347;is, or Mooltrikon R&#257;&#347;is, even a person of
base birth will become king.</p>

<p>46. If six Grahas are exalted, the native will become emperor
and will enjoy various kinds of royal paraphernalia.</p>

<p>47. Even, if one among Guru, &#346;ukr and Budh is in
exaltation, while a benefic is in a Kendr, the native will
become a king, or be equal to him.</p>

<p>48. If all benefics are relegated to Kendras, while malefics
are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava, the native, though may be of
mean descent, will ascend the throne.</p>

<h2><a name=40>Ch. 40. Yogas For Royal Association</a></h2>

<p>1. If Karm’s Lord is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from
the dispositor of Amatya Karak, or even, if Karm’s Lord is yuti
with, or receives a Drishti from Amatya Karak himself, the
native will be a chief in the king’s court.</p>

<p>2. If Karm and Labh Bhava are devoid of malefic occupation
and devoid of Drishti from a malefic, while Labh Bhava receives
a Drishti from its own Lord, the native will be a chief in the
king’s court.</p>

<p>3. Should Amatya Karak and the dispositor of Atma Karak be
together, the native will be endowed with great intelligence and
will be a king’s minister. (‘Karakendr’ is interpreted here, as
the dispositor of Atma Karak. Similarly ‘Amatyesa’ means the
dispositor of Amatya Karak)</p>

<p>4. If Atma Karak is strong and is with a benefic, or Amatya
Karak is in its own Bhava, or in exaltation, one will surely
become a king’s minister.</p>

<p>5. There is no doubt in one’s becoming a king’s minister and
famous, if Atma Karak is in Tanu, or Putr, or Dharm Bhava.</p>

<p>6. If Atma Karak, or Amatya Karak is placed in a Kendr, or in
a Kon, the native will beget royal mercy, royal patronage and
happiness thereof.</p>

<p>7. Should malefics be in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the
6<sup>th</sup> from Atma Karak, or from Arudh Lagn, or in Sahaj
and Ari Bhava, one will become Army chief.</p>

<p>8. If Atma Karak is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, or in
exaltation, or in its own Bhava and gives a Drishti to Dharm’s
Lord, the native will be a king’s minister.</p>

<p>9. If the Lord of the R&#257;&#347;i, where Candr is placed
becomes Atma Karak and, if this Lord is placed in Tanu Bhava
along with a benefic, the native will become a king’s minister
at his advanced age.</p>

<p>10. Should the Atma Karak be in Putr, Yuvati, Karm, or Dharm
Bhava and happen to be with a benefic, one will earn wealth
through royal patronage.</p>

<p>11. If the Arudh of Dharm Bhava happens to be itself the Janm
Lagn, or, if Atma Karak is placed in Dharm Bhava, the native
will be associated with royal circles.</p>

<p>12. One will gain through royal association, if Labh Bhava is
occupied by its own Lord and is devoid of a Drishti from a
malefic. The Atma Karak should at the same time be yuti with a
benefic.</p>

<p>13. An exchange of R&#257;&#347;is between Karm’s Lord and
Lagn’s Lord will make the native associated with the king in a
great manner.</p>

<p>14. If &#346;ukr and Candr are in the 4<sup>th</sup> from
Karak&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn, the native will be endowed with
royal insignia.</p>

<p>15. Should Lagn’s Lord, or the Atma Karak be yuti with Putr’s
Lord and be in a Kendr, or in a Kon, the native will be a king,
or minister.</p>

<h2><a name=41>Ch. 41. Combinations for Wealth</a></h2>

<p>1. I now tell you of special combinations, giving wealth. One
born to these Yogas will surely become wealthy.</p>

<p>2. Yogas for Great Affluence (up to Sloka 8). Should a
R&#257;&#347;i of &#346;ukr be Putr Bhava and be occupied by
&#346;ukr himself, while Mangal is in Labh Bhava, the native
will obtain great riches.</p>

<p>3. Should a R&#257;&#347;i of Budh be Putr Bhava and be
occupied by Budh himself, as Labh Bhava is occupied by Candr,
Mangal and Guru, the native will be very affluent.</p>

<p>4. Should Simh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by S&#363;rya
himself, as &#346;ani, Candr and Guru are in Labh Bhava, the
native will be very affluent.</p>

<p>5. Should S&#363;rya and Candr be in Labh Bhava, as &#346;ani
is in Putr Bhava identical with his own Bhava, the native will
be very affluent.</p>

<p>6. Should Guru be in Putr Bhava identical with his own
R&#257;&#347;i, as Budh is in Labh Bhava, the native will be
very affluent.</p>

<p>7. If a R&#257;&#347;i of Mangal happens to be Putr Bhava
with Mangal therein, while &#346;ukr is in Labh Bhava, the
native will become very affluent.</p>

<p>8. If Kark happens to be Putr Bhava, containing Candr
therein, while &#346;ani is in Labh Bhava, the native will
become very affluent.</p>

<p>9. Yogas for Wealth (up to Sloka 15).  Should S&#363;rya be
in Simh identical with Lagn and be yuti with, or receiving a
Drishti from Mangal and Guru, one will be wealthy.</p>

<p>10. Should Candr be in Kark identical with Lagn and be yuti
with, or receiving a Drishti from Budh and Guru, one will be
wealthy.</p>

<p>11. Should Mangal be in Lagn identical with his own
R&#257;&#347;i and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from
Budh, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani, the native will be rich.</p>

<p>12. Should Budh’s R&#257;&#347;i be Lagn with Budh therein
and should Budh be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from
&#346;ani and Guru, the native will be rich.</p>

<p>13. Should Guru be in Lagn identical with his own
R&#257;&#347;i and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from
Budh and Mangal, the native will be rich.</p>

<p>14. If &#346;ukr happens to be in Lagn identical with his own
R&#257;&#347;i and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from
&#346;ani and Budh, one will be wealthy.</p>

<p>15. If &#346;ani is in his own R&#257;&#347;i identical with
Lagn and receiving a Drishti from, or being yuti with Mangal and
Guru, the native will be wealthy.</p>

<p>16. Other Qualified Grahas. Dharm’s Lord and Putr’s Lord are
capable of bestowing wealth. Similarly Grahas, yuti with Dharm’s
Lord and/or Putr’s Lord are capable of bestowing wealth. There
is no doubt, that these Grahas will give wealth during their
Dasha periods.</p>

<p>17. The Yogas, mentioned above (up to Sloka 16) should be
delineated after knowing favourable, or unfavourable
dispositions of the participant Grahas and their strength and
weakness.</p>

<p>18-19. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of the Lords of
Kendras. If the Lord of a Kendr is in Parijat&#257;&#324;&#347;,
the native will be liberal, if in Uttam&#257;&#324;&#347;, will
be highly liberal, if in Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be
endowed with prowess, if in Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be
honourable, if in Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be valorous,
if in Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be head of an assembly, if
in Brahmalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be a sage and, if in
Iravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be delighted and be celebrated in
all quarters.</p>

<p>20-22. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Putr’s Lord. If
Putr’s Lord is in Parijat&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will
take to the branch of learning, befitting his race, if in
Uttam&#257;&#324;&#347;, will have excellent learning, if in
Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347;, will receive world-wide honours, if in
Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347;, will become a minister, if in also
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge,
if in Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be a Karm Yogi (performer
of actions, worldly and religious rites), if in
Brahmalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be devoted to the Lord and, if
in Iravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be pious.</p>

<p>23-27. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Dharm’s Lord.
If Dharm’s Lord is in Parijat&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will
visit holy places, if in Uttam&#257;&#324;&#347;, has been
visiting holy places in the past births and he will do the same
within this life-time, if in Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347;, will
perform sacrificial rites, if in Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347;,
will be mighty and truthful, conquerer of his senses and will
concentrate only on the Brahman, giving up all religions, if in
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be the greatest of ascetics, if
in Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be an ascetic, holding a
cudgel (Lagudi), or he will be a religious mendicant, that has
renounced all mundane attachments and carrying three long
staves, tied together, in his right hand (Tridandin) and, if in
Brahmalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, will perform Aswamedh Yagya (Horse
Sacrifice) and will attain the state of Lord Indra, if in
Iravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be a synonym of Dharma, or
virtues just, as Lord Ram and Yudhishtira.</p>

<p>28. Lords of Kendras and Konas Related. The Kendras are
known, as Vishnu Sthanas (Bhavas of Lord Vishnu), while the
Konas are called Lakshmi Sthanas. If the Lord of a Kendr
establishes a relationship with the Lord of a Kon, a Raj Yog is
obtained.</p>

<p>(A sixth kind of relationship can also be extended in this
context to Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; positions, though there is no
specific classic sanction for this. For example in the case of a
Makar native Mangal in the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of &#346;ukr
and &#346;ukr in the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of Mangal will confer
a superior Raj Yog. This form of relationship will be equally
superior, like the first 3 relationships, mentioned in the
earlier paragraph).</p>

<p>29-34 Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Related Lords of
Kendras and Lords of Konas. If the Lord of a Kendr and the Lord
of a Kon, having a relationship, as indicated in Sloka 28,
happen to be in Parijat&#257;&#324;&#347;, the native will be
king and will protect men, if in Uttam&#257;&#324;&#347;, will
be an excellent king, endowed with elephants, horses, chariots
etc., if in Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347;, will be a tiger of kings,
honoured by other kings and, if in Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347;,
will be an emperor, ruling over the entire earth. With the said
Raj Yog relationship of the said Grahas in
Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347; were born Harish Candr, Manu, Bali,
Agni Deva and many emperors. In the present Yuga so born is
Yudhishtira (Dharm Raj of Mahabharat). Salivahana’s birth and
that of others will also come with this Yog. With such Lords,
placed in Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, Manu etc. were born. The
Incarnations of Lord Vishnu took place, when such Lords were
placed in Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347;. With such Lords, placed in
Brahmalok&#257;&#324;&#347;, Lord Brahma was born and, placed in
Iravat&#257;&#324;&#347;, the Swayambhu Manu was born. (Manu is
the first of the 14 Manus, identified, as the second creator,
who produced the Prajapatis. To Manu the code of laws, Manu
Smriti is ascribed).</p>

<h2><a name=42>Ch. 42. Combinations for Penury</a></h2>

<p>1. O Lord, you have stated many Yogas, related to acquisition
of wealth. Please tell me such Yogas, causing utter poverty.</p>

<p>2. The native will be penniless, if Lagn’s Lord is in Vyaya
Bhava, while Vyaya’s Lord is in Lagn along with the Lord of a
Marak, or receives a Drishti from such a Grah.</p>

<p>3. The native will be penniless, if Lagn’s Lord is in Ari
Bhava, while Ari’s Lord is in Lagn, yuti with, or receiving a
Drishti from a Marak Lord.</p>

<p>4. Should Lagn, or Candr be with Ketu, while Lagn’s Lord is
in Randhr Bhava, the person concerned will be penniless.</p>

<p>5. If Lagn’s Lord along with a malefic is in Ari, Randhr, or
Vyaya Bhava, while Dhan’s Lord is in an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i,
or in debilitation, even a native of royal scion will become
penniless.</p>

<p>6. If Lagn’s Lord is yuti with the Lord of Ari, Randhr, or
Vyaya Bhava, or with &#346;ani and, if Lagn’s Lord is devoid of
a Drishti from a benefic, the native will be penniless.</p>

<p>7. Should Putr’s and Dharm’s Lords be, respectively, found in
Ari and Vyaya Bhava and receive a Drishti from Marak Grahas, the
native will be penniless.</p>

<p>8. If malefics, excepting the Lords of Karm and Dharm Bhava,
happen to be in Lagn, associated with, or receiving a Drishti
from Marak Grahas, one will become penniless.</p>

<p>9. Note the Grahas, that are ruling the R&#257;&#347;is,
occupied by the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava. If the
said dispositors are in such evil Bhavas in turn and are
associated with, or receive a Drishti from malefics, the native
will be miserable and indigent.</p>

<p>10. The Lord of the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, occupied by Candr,
joining a Marak Grah, or occupying a Marak Bhava, will make one
penniless.</p>

<p>11. Should the Lord of the natal Lagn and that of the
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn be yuti with, or receive a Drishti
from Marak Grahas, one will be penniless.</p>

<p>12. If inauspicious Bhavas are occupied by benefics, while
auspicious Bhavas are occupied by malefics, the native will be
indigent and will be distressed even in the matter of food.</p>

<p>13. A Grah, associated with one of the Lords of Ari, Randhr
and Vyaya Bhava, being bereft of a Drishti from the Lord of a
Kon, will in its Dasha periods cause harm to the native’s
financial aspects.</p>

<p>14. If the 8<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup> from Atma Karak, or
Randhr/Vyaya Bhava receive a Drishti from the Atma Karak’s
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; Lord and the Lord of Janma Lagn, the
native will be bereft of wealth.</p>

<p>15. The native will be a spendthrift, if the 12<sup>th</sup>
from Atma Karak receives a Drishti from the dispositor of Atma
Karak, or, if Vyaya Bhava receives a Drishti from the Lord of
Lagn.</p>

<p>16-18. Now I tell you some Yogas for poverty along with
conditions of their nullifications. Should Mangal and &#346;ani
be together in Dhan Bhava, the native’s wealth will be
destroyed.  Should Budh give a Drishti to Mangal and &#346;ani
in Dhan Bhava, there will be great wealth. There is no doubt in
it. S&#363;rya in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti from
&#346;ani, will cause penury, while, if S&#363;rya is in Dhan
Bhava and does not receive a Drishti from &#346;ani, riches and
fame will be obtained. The same effects (poverty) will be
declared, if &#346;ani is in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti
from S&#363;rya.</p>

<h2><a name=43>Ch. 43. Longevity</a></h2>

<p>1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have dealt with combinations for
wealth and poverty. Kindly detail methods of ascertaining the
life-span of human beings.</p>

<p>2-3. O Brahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate methods
of ascertaining longevity. Knowing that longevity is difficult
even for gods. Many exponents have laid down various methods of
longevity calculations. Following is the summary of such schools
of thought.</p>

<p>4-8. Pindayu. The Grahas contribute to longevity, according
to their being in exaltation, or debilitation and also based on
their strengths and weaknesses and positions in Ashvini etc. and
in the various R&#257;&#347;is. First of all Pindayu is based on
the positions of the Grahas. O Brahmin, listen carefully to what
I say: 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21 and 20 are the number of years,
contributed by the Grahas, from S&#363;rya etc., when in
exaltation. These are half of the above in debilitation. And, if
the Grahas are in between exaltation and debilitation, the rule
of three process should be used. Deduct the actual position of
the Grah from its deep exaltation point. If the product is less
than 6 R&#257;&#347;is, deduct it again from 12 R&#257;&#347;is.
The product concerned should be multiplied by the number of
years allotted to the Grah and divided by 12 to get the Grah’s
actual contribution.</p>

<p>9. Rectifications. Excepting &#346;ukr and &#346;ani, the
contributions, made by others, should be halved, if they are
eclipsed by S&#363;rya. One third should be reduced, if the Grah
is in its inimical R&#257;&#347;i. This does not apply to the
one in retrogression (see Vakra Charam).</p>

<p>10-11. Deductions for Grahas in the Visible Half of the
Zodiac. Full, half, one third, one fourth, one fifth and one
sixth are the deductions of contributions, made by malefics,
placed in the visible half of the zodiac. Benefics in such cases
lose only half of what malefics lose. Should there be more than
one Grah in a Bhava, the deduction, due to the strongest, will
only prevail and not deductions, due to other Grahas in that
particular Bhava. Waning Candr is a benefic for this
purpose.</p>

<p>12-13. Malefics in Lagn. In case Tanu Bhava is occupied by
malefics, adopt the following procedure. Convert Lagn’s Sphuta
into minutes of arc and multiply it by the years etc.,
contributed by the occupant, and divide by 21600. The years etc.
so arrived be deducted from the respective contribution, which
will be the net span, donated by the Grah. If there is benefic’s
Drishti on Lagn, containing malefics, then the loss is only
half.</p>

<p>14-15. Lagn’s Contribution. The number of years, contributed
by Lagn, will correspond to the number of R&#257;&#347;is it
gained (from Mesh), while the degrees Lagn has gained in the
particular R&#257;&#347;i will also correspondingly donate (30°
= l year). If the Lagn’s Lord in the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; is
stronger than Lagn’s Lord, then the contribution should be
computed only based on the number of Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as
gained (from Mesh), otherwise the computation will be for the
R&#257;&#347;i Lagn.</p>

<p>16-17. Nisargayu. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Nisargayu.
1, 2, 9, 20, 18, 20 and 50 are the years, allotted to Candr,
Mangal, Budh, &#346;ukr, Guru, S&#363;rya and &#346;ani from the
period of birth.</p>

<p>18-19. A&#324;&#347;ayu. Now I will tell you about
A&#324;&#347;ayu contributions by Lagn and Grahas. The years
correspond to the number of Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as, counted
from Mesh.  Multiply the longitude in question by 108. If the
product exceeds 12, expunge multiples of 12 and consider the
final product in R&#257;&#347;is, degrees etc., as years, months
etc.</p>

<p>20-22. The same reductions, as per Pindayu, apply to
A&#324;&#347;ayu as well; i.e. half for a combust Grah, one
third for inimical placement and the ones, due for placements in
the half of the zodiac, counted from the 12<sup>th</sup>
backwards. Some scholars suggest further corrections for
A&#324;&#347;ayu, viz. to increase threefold the contribution of
a Grah in exaltation, or in own Bhava and double the
contribution, if the contributor is in his own
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in his own Dreshkan. If doubling and
trebling is warranted, only trebling be done. In case of
reductions also only halving is to be done, if both halving and
reducing a third are required. That is how the final life-span
of men be understood.</p>

<p>23. Longevity for Other Living Beings. For other living
beings as well such computations can be made. The said figure
should be multiplied by the figure, corresponding to its full
span of life and divided by the figure, corresponding to the
full span of life for human beings.</p>

<p>24-29. Full Life Span of Various Living Beings. Now I’ll tell
you about the full life-span figures for various living beings.
Gods and sages enjoy endless life-span (in astronomical
proportions, as against ordinary mortals). The full life-span of
eagles, owls, parrots, crows and snakes is one thousand years.
For falcon, monkey, bear and frog the full span of life is 300
years. Demon’s full life-span is 150 years, while it is 120 for
human beings, 32 for horses, 25 for donkeys and camels, 24 for
oxen and buffaloes, 20 for peacocks, 16 for goats and rams. 14
for swans, 12 for cuckoo, dog and dove, 8 for hens etc. and 7
for birds etc.</p>

<p>30-31. Choice of Longevity. I have narrated 3 different
methods of longevity. Listen to me about the choice among the
three systems. According to which of the three, Lagn,
S&#363;rya, or Candr is stronger than the other two,
A&#324;&#347;ayu, Pindayu, or Nisargayu should be, respectively,
chosen.</p>

<p>32. Doubtful Cases. If two among Lagn, S&#363;rya and Candr
gain equal strength, then longevity should be worked out, as per
both systems and the average of both should be considered. If
all the three are equally strong, the average of the three
should be considered.</p>

<p>33-40. Other Clues to Longevity. O excellent of the Brahmins,
I will now give you details of other methods in the matter of
longevity, as under. This is based on the positions of Lagn’s
Lord, Randhr’s Lord, &#346;ani, Candr, natal Lagn and Hora Lagn.
These six are grouped into three groups thus: the Lords of Lagn
and of Randhr Bhava on the one hand, &#346;ani and Candr on the
other hand and the natal Lagn and Hora Lagn on yet the other
hand. Out of a group of two, if the two are in Movable
R&#257;&#347;is, long life is denoted. One in a Fixed
R&#257;&#347;i and the other in a Dual R&#257;&#347;i will also
bestow long life. One in a Movable R&#257;&#347;i and the other
in a Fixed R&#257;&#347;i will give medium life. If both are in
Dual R&#257;&#347;is, then again medium life will be obtained.
Short life is denoted, if one is in a Movable R&#257;&#347;i, as
the other is in a Dual R&#257;&#347;i, or, if both are in Fixed
R&#257;&#347;is. The type of life, denoted by three, or two
groups be only considered. If the three groups denote different
scales, then the one, indicated by the pair of natal Lagn and
Hora Lagn should be only considered. In case of three different
indications, if Candr is in Lagn, or Yuvati Bhava, then the one,
indicated by the &#346;ani-Candr pair will only come to
pass.</p>

<p>41-44. Further Clarifications. If long life is denoted by all
the said three groups, the span is 120 years, if by two groups,
it is 108 years and, if only by one group it is 91 years. If
medium life is arrived at by three groups, it is 80 years, if
indicated by 2 groups, it is 72 years and, if by one group, it
is 64 years. If short life is denoted by the said three groups,
it is only 32 years, if indicated by two groups, the life-span
is 36 years and, if by one group, the life-span is 40 years.
These are rectified, as under.</p>

<p>45-46. Rectifications. If the contributor is in the beginning
of a R&#257;&#347;i, his donation will be full and it will be
nil, if he is at the end of a R&#257;&#347;i. For intermediary
placements rule of three process will apply. Add the longitudes
of the contributors and the sum so arrived at must be divided by
the number of contributors. The latest product should be
multiplied by the number of basic years and divided by 30.  This
will yield the net longevity.</p>

<p>47. Special Rule for &#346;ani. Should &#346;ani be a
contributor, the class of longevity declines. Some advocate
contrarily an increase of class in this context. If &#346;ani is
in its own R&#257;&#347;i, or in exaltation, change in class
will not occur. Even, if he receives a Drishti from, or is yuti
with only a malefic, no change occurs.</p>

<p>48. Special Rule for Guru. If Guru is in Lagn, or in Yuvati
Bhava and receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with only
benefics, the class of longevity will increase.</p>

<p>49-50. Increase and Fall in Class of Longevity. From very
short life to short life, from short life to medium life, from
medium life to long life and from long life to extremely long
life are the increases in the classification of longevity, when
Guru warrants an increase.  The reverse is true, if &#346;ani
warrants a fall in the span of life.</p>

<p>51. (Maitreya says) You have narrated various kinds of
longevity computations. Please favour me by denoting subtle
classes thereof and poor and long life-spans.</p>

<p>52. (Maharishi Parashar replies) These are seven-fold, viz.
Bal Risht, Yog Risht, short, medium, long, super-natural (Divya)
and immortality (Amritayu).</p>

<p>53-54. The life-span in Bal Risht is 8 years, in Yog Risht 20
years, in short, medium and long lives, respectively, 32, 64 and
120 years. Super-natural life-span is 1000 years. Above this
super-natural life-span of 1000 years it is Amritayu, which can
be acquired only by those, who deserve it.</p>

<p>55. Limitless Longevity. Should Kark be Lagn with Guru and
Candr therein, while &#346;ukr and Budh are in Kendras and
others are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava, the native will obtain
limitless longevity.</p>

<p>56. Super-Natural Longevity. One having benefics in Kendras
and/or Konas, while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava
will obtain super-natural life-span. Randhr Bhava in this case
should be one of the R&#257;&#347;is, owned by a benefic.</p>

<p>57. Living until the End of the Yuga. One born in Kark Lagn
will live till the end of the Yuga, if Guru is in a Kendr and
happens to be in Gopur&#257;&#324;&#347;, while &#346;ukr is in
a Kon and happens to be in Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;.</p>

<p>58. Living the Life-Span of a Sage. Guru in
Simhasan&#257;&#324;&#347;, being in Lagn, &#346;ani in
Devalok&#257;&#324;&#347; and Mangal in
Paravat&#257;&#324;&#347;. If these are so, one will enjoy the
life-span, as due to a sage.</p>

<p>59. Good Yogas increase the life-span and bad Yogas decrease
the same. Hence I tell you such Yogas, as to know of full,
medium and short span combinations.</p>

<p>60. If a Kendr contains a benefic, while Lagn’s Lord is yuti
with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic, or Guru in
particular, the native will live a full span of life.</p>

<p>61. Should Lagn’s Lord be in a Kendr yuti with, or receiving
a Drishti from Guru and &#346;ukr, full life-span will
result.</p>

<p>62. If at birth three Grahas are exalted, out of which the
Lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are inclusive, as Randhr Bhava is
devoid of a malefic in it, full life-span will result.</p>

<p>63. Long life is denoted, if three Grahas are in Randhr
Bhava, in exaltation, own, or friendly divisions, while Lagn’s
Lord is strong.</p>

<p>64. If &#346;ani, or Lagn’s Lord is yuti with any exalted
Grah, long life will result.</p>

<p>65. Long life will be enjoyed, if malefics are in Sahaj, Ari
and Labh Bhava, while benefics are in Kendras.</p>

<p>66. If Ari, Yuvati and Randhr Bhava are occupied by benefics,
while malefics are in Sahaj and Labh Bhava, full life-span will
follow the birth.</p>

<p>67. If Randhr’s Lord is friendly to S&#363;rya, while
malefics are in Ari and Vyaya Bhava, as Lagn’s Lord is in a
Kendr, the native will live the full span of life.</p>

<p>68. O excellent of the Brahmins, if a malefic is in Randhr
Bhava, while Karm’s Lord is exalted, one will be long-lived.</p>

<p>69. Long life will follow, if Lagn is a Dual R&#257;&#347;i,
while Lagn’s Lord is in a Kendr, or in exaltation, or in a
Kon.</p>

<p>70. Should Lagn be a Dual R&#257;&#347;i, while two malefics
are in a Kendr with reference to a strong Lagn’s Lord, long life
is indicated.</p>

<p>71-73. If the stronger among Lagn’s Lord and Randhr’s Lord is
placed in a Kendr, long life is indicated and, if in a
Panaphara, medium life is indicated, if in Apoklima, short life
will come to pass. According to Lagn’s Lord being friendly,
neutral, or inimical to S&#363;rya, long, medium, or short life
will result.</p>

<p>74. Should Mangal and Sahaj’s Lord, or Randhr’s Lord and
&#346;ani be combust, or be yuti with malefics, or receive a
Drishti from malefics, there will be short life.</p>

<p>75. If Lagn’s Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, yuti
with malefics and devoid of Yuti with and/or Drishti from a
benefic, short life will come to pass.</p>

<p>76. If malefics are in Kendras, devoid of Yuti with, or a
Drishti from benefics, while Lagn’s Lord is not strong, only
short life will result.</p>

<p>77. O excellent of Brahmins, if Vyaya and Dhan Bhava are
occupied by malefics and devoid of a Drishti from a benefic, or
of Yuti with a benefic, the native will be short-lived.</p>

<p>78. If the Lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are bereft of
dignities and strength, short life will come to pass. If the
Lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are helped by others, while being
so, medium life-span will come to pass.</p>

<h2><a name=44>Ch. 44. Marak Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have mentioned a lot about
longevity. Be kind enough to throw light on Marakas, or
killers.</p>

<p>2-5. O Brahmin, Sahaj and Randhr Bhava are the two Bhavas of
longevity. The Bhavas, related to death, are the 12<sup>th</sup>
from each of these, i.e. Dhan and Yuvati Bhava are Marak
Bhavas.</p>

<p>3. Out of the two, Dhan Bhava is a powerful Marak Bhava. The
Lords of Dhan and Yuvati Bhava, malefics in Dhan and Yuvati
Bhava and malefics, yuti with Dhan’s Lord and yuti with Yuvati’s
Lord are all known, as Marakas. The major and sub-periods of
these Grahas will bring death on the native, depending on
whether he is a long life, medium life, or short life
person.</p>

<p>6-7. The Dasha of a benefic Grah, related to Vyaya’s Lord may
also inflict death. End may descend on the native in Randhr’s
Lord’s Dasha. The Dasha of a Grah, which is an exclusive
malefic, may also cause death.</p>

<p>9. Should &#346;ani be ill-disposed and be related to a Marak
Grah, he will be the first to kill in preference to other
Grahas.</p>

<p>10-14. O Brahmin, I tell you further about Marakas. Narrated
earlier are three kinds of life-spans, viz. short, medium and
long. Short life is before 32 years, later on up to 64 it is
medium life and from 64 to 100 it is long life. Beyond 100 the
longevity is called supreme. O excellent of the Brahmins, it is
impossible to decide upon longevity till the native is 20 years
old. Till such year the child should be protected by sacred
recitations, religious offerings (of Gh&#299; etc.) to
consecrated fire, as prescribed in the Vedas etc. and through
medical treatments, for premature death may descend on the child
due to sins of father and mother, or of its own (in the previous
birth).</p>

<p>15-21. I further mention about the Marak Grahas. One born
with short life combinations may face death in the Dasha,
denoted by Vipat star (3<sup>rd</sup> from the birth star), one
of medium life may die in the Dasha, denoted by Pratyak star
(5<sup>th</sup> from the birth star). In the Dasha, denoted by
Vadh star (7<sup>th</sup> from the birth star), one with long
life may obtain his end. The Dasha of the Lord of the
22<sup>nd</sup> Dreshkan, or 23<sup>rd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup>,
or 5<sup>th</sup>, or 7<sup>th</sup> asterisms may also cause
death. The Lords of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup>,
counted from Kark, may bring death. This is true, when Candr is
a malefic. If he happens to be a benefic, there will be diseases
(not death). Death may come to pass in the Dasha of Ari’s Lord
and in the subperiods of Ari’s, Randhr’s and/or Vyaya’s Lords.
Should there be many Marakas and, if these Marakas are strong,
there will be diseases, miseries etc. in major and sub-periods.
Thus these are Marakas and are primarily related to bring death
upon the native.  According to their dispositions there may be
death, or difficulties.</p>

<p>22-24. Rahu and Ketu, as Marakas. If Rahu, or Ketu are placed
in Tanu, Yuvati, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or happen to be in the
7<sup>th</sup> from a Marak Lord, or are placed with such a
Grah, they acquire powers of killing in their major, or
sub-periods. For one born in Makar, or in Vrischik, Rahu will be
a Marak. Should Rahu be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, he will
give difficulties in his Dasha periods. He will not, however, do
so, if Rahu receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a
benefic.</p>

<p>25-31. Sahaj Bhava and Death. O excellent of Brahmins, if
S&#363;rya, being with strength, is in Sahaj Bhava, one will
obtain his death, due to a king (legal punishments). Candr in
Sahaj Bhava will cause death, due to tuberculosis, while wounds,
weapons, fire and thirst will cause death through Mangal in
Sahaj Bhava. If Sahaj Bhava receives a Drishti from, or is
occupied by &#346;ani and Rahu, death will be through poison,
water, or fire, or fall from heights, or confinement. Death will
surely come to descend through insects, or leprosy, if Candr and
Gulik occupy, or give a Drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Budh, giving a
Drishti to, or occupying Sahaj Bhava, will bring death, followed
by fever. Guru in Sahaj Bhava, or giving a Drishti to Sahaj
Bhava, will cause death by swelling, or tumours. Urinary
diseases will cause death, if &#346;ukr is in, or gives a
Drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Many Grahas, giving a Drishti to, or
occupying Sahaj Bhava, will bring death through many
diseases.</p>

<p>32. If Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a benefic, death will be in
an auspicious place (like a shrine) and, if Sahaj Bhava is
occupied by a malefic, death will be in sinful places. Mixed
occupation of Sahaj Bhava will yield mixed results with regard
to the place of death.</p>

<p>33. Consciousness will prevail at the time of death, if Guru,
or &#346;ukr are placed in Sahaj Bhava. With other Grahas in
Sahaj Bhava there will be unconsciousness before death.</p>

<p>34. According to Sahaj Bhava being a Movable, a Fixed, or a
Dual R&#257;&#347;i, death will be, respectively, in a foreign
place (other than native birth place), in one’s own house, or on
the way.</p>

<p>35-36. Occupants of Randhr Bhava. Note the occupant of Randhr
Bhava. If it is S&#363;rya, death will be through fire, if Candr
is in Randhr Bhava, through water, if Mangal, through weapons,
if Budh, through fever, if Guru, through diseases, if &#346;ukr,
through hunger and, if &#346;ani, through thirst.</p>

<p>37. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by, or receives a Drishti
from a benefic, while Dharm’s Lord is yuti with a benefic, the
native will die in a shrine. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by, or
receives a Drishti from a malefic, while Dharm’s Lord is yuti
with a malefic, death will be in a place, other than a
shrine.</p>

<p>38-39. Fate of the Human Physical System.  Should there be a
benefic’s Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava (22<sup>nd</sup> Dreshkan),
the body will be burnt in fire (as prescribed in Shastras). If a
malefic’s Dreshkan happens to be in Randhr Bhava, the body will
be thrown away in water. If the Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is
owned by a mixed Grah, the dead body will only dry up. If the
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is a serpent Dreshkan, the body will be
eaten away by animals, crows etc.</p>

<p>40. Serpent Dreshkanas. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
Dreshkan in Kark, the initial one in Vrischik and the last one
in Meen are designated, as serpent Dreshkanas.</p>

<p>41-42. Pre-natal Abode. O excellent of Brahmins, the stronger
of the two luminaries, S&#363;rya and Candr, occupying a
Dreshkan of Guru, denotes the descent from the world of gods. If
the stronger of the luminaries occupies the Dreshkan of
&#346;ukr, or Candr, the descent is from the world of the Manes,
if the stronger of the two luminaries is in the Dreshkan of
S&#363;rya, or Mangal, the descent is from the world of Yama
(world of the death) and, if in Dreshkan of Budh, or &#346;ani,
the descent is from the hell.</p>

<p>43-45. Ascent after Death. According to the following Grahas
in Vyaya, Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain
one of the different worlds after death: Guru heaven, Candr, or
&#346;ukr the world of Manes, Mangal and/or S&#363;rya earth
(rebirth), Budh and/or &#346;ani hell. In case the said Bhavas
are not occupied, the native will go to the world, indicated by
the stronger of the Dreshkan Lords, related to Ari and Randhr
Bhava. The relative Grah’s exaltation etc. will denote the high,
medium and low status the native will obtain in the said
world.</p>

<p>46. Other Grahas and R&#257;&#347;is, becoming Marakas, are
being discussed in the chapter, related to Dashas.</p>

<h2><a name=45>Ch. 45. Avasthas of Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have earlier stated, that the
Avasthas, or states of the Grahas are to be considered in the
context of the effects of the Grahas. Be so kind to tell me
about this.</p>

<p>2. O excellent of Brahmins, various kinds of Avasthas of the
Grahas have been expounded. Out of these, I will give you the
summary of Baal (infant) and other states of the Grahas.</p>

<p>3. Baal, Kumar, Yuv, Vriddh and Mrit Avastha (Baal Adi
Avasthas). Infant, youthful, adolescent, old and dead are the
states of the Grahas, placed in the ascending order at the rate
of six degrees in odd R&#257;&#347;is. In the case of even
R&#257;&#347;is this arrangement is in reverse order. (Vriddh -
Advanced, Mrit - In extremis)</p>

<p>4. Results. One fourth, half, full, negligible and nil are
the grades of the results, due to a Grah in infant, youthful,
adolescent, old and dead Avasthas.</p>

<p>5. Awakening, Dreaming and Sleeping States.  If a Grah is in
its own R&#257;&#347;i, or in exaltation, it is said to be in a
state of awakening (alertness). In the R&#257;&#347;i of a
friend, or of a neutral it is in dreaming state, while in an
enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, or in debilitation it is in a state of
sleeping.</p>

<p>6. According to a Grah, being in Awakening, Dreaming, or
Sleeping states, the results, due to it will be full, medium, or
nil.</p>

<p>7. Other Kinds of States. There are nine kinds of other
Avasthas, viz. Dipt, Swasth, Pramudit, Shanta, Din, Vikal,
Duhkhit, Khal and Kop.</p>

<p>8-10. If a Grah is in its exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, it is in
Dipt Avastha, if in its own R&#257;&#347;i, it is in Swasth, if
in a great friend’s R&#257;&#347;i, it is in Pramudit, if in a
friendly R&#257;&#347;i, it is in Shanta, if in a neutral
R&#257;&#347;i, it is in Din, if a Grah is yuti with a malefic,
it is in Vikal, if is in an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, it is in
Duhkhit, if in a great enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, it is in Khal
and, if a Grah is being eclipsed by S&#363;rya, it is in Kop.
Depending on such a state of the Grah, the Bhava, occupied by it
will obtain corresponding effects.</p>

<p>11-18. Yet other Avasthas. Lajjit, Garvit, Kshudhit, Trushit,
Mudit and Kshobhit are the other kinds of Avasthas, due to the
Grahas. Placed in Putr Bhava, if a Grah is associated with Rahu,
or Ketu, or with S&#363;rya, &#346;ani, or Mangal, it is in
Lajjit Avastha. If a Grah is in exaltation, or in Mooltrikon, it
is Garvit. If a Grah is in an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, or yuti
with an enemy, or receives a Drishti from an enemy, or even, if
a Grah is yuti with &#346;ani, the Avastha is Kshudhit. If a
Grah is in a watery R&#257;&#347;i and receives a Drishti from a
malefic, but does not receive a Drishti from a benefic, the
Avastha is called Trushit. If a Grah is in a friendly
R&#257;&#347;i, or is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a
benefic, or is yuti with Guru, it is said to be in Mudit
Avastha. If a Grah is yuti with S&#363;rya and receives a
Drishti from, or is yuti with a malefic, or receives a Drishti
from an enemy, it is said to be in Kshobhit. The Bhavas,
occupied by a Grah in Kshudhit, or in Kshobhit, are
destroyed.</p>

<p>19-23. The learned should estimate the effects, due to a
Bhava, in the manner, cited above, after ascertaining the
strength and weakness. Weak Grahas cause reduction in good
effects, while stronger ones give greater effects. If a Grah,
posited in Karm Bhava, is in Lajjit, Kshudhit Avastha, or
Kshobhit Avastha, the person will always be subjected to
miseries. If a Grah in Putr is in Lajjit, there will be
destruction of progeny, or there will be only one surviving
child. Surely the wife of the native will die, if there is a
Grah in Yuvati in Kshobhit, or in Trushit Avastha.</p>

<p>24-29. Effects of Garvit, Mudit, Lajjit, Kshobhit, Kshudhit
and Trushit Avastha. A Grah in Garvit Avastha will cause
happiness through new houses and gardens, regalhood, skill in
arts, financial gains at all times and improvement in business.
A Grah in Mudit Avastha will give residences, clothes,
ornaments, happiness from lands and wife, happiness from
relatives, living in royal places, destruction of enemies and
acquisition of wisdom and learning. A Grah in Lajjit will give
aversion to God, loss of intelligence, loss of child, interest
in evil speeches and listlessness in good things. A Grah in
Kshobhit will give acute penury, evil disposition, miseries,
financial debacles, distress to feet and obstruction to income,
due to royal wrath. A Grah in Kshudhit will cause downfall, due
to grief and passion, grief on account of relatives, physical
decline, troubles from enemies, financial distress, loss of
physical strength and an eclipsed mind, due to miseries. A Grah
in Trushit Avastha will cause diseases through association with
females, leading over wicked deeds, loss of wealth, due to one’s
own men, physical weakness, miseries, caused by evil people and
decline of honour.</p>

<p>30-37. Calculation of Shayan Adi Avasthas.  Now I will tell
you of the Avasthas, viz. Shayan, Upavesan, Netrapani, Prakash,
Gaman, Agaman, Sabh, Agam, Bhojan, Nritya Lips, Kautuk and Nidr
and the Chesthas of such Avasthas. Note the number of the star,
occupied by the Grah, for which an Avastha is to be calculated.
Multiply that number by the number, denoted by the Grah
(S&#363;rya 1 to &#346;ani 7). The figure so arrived at should
again be multiplied by the number of the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
where the Grah is in. Add to this the number of the birth
asterism (ruling star, the one, occupied by Candr), the number
of Ghatis of birth and the number of R&#257;&#347;is, Lagn
gained from Mesh (Mesh 1, Vrishabh 2 and so forth). This figure
should be divided by 12 and the remainder will indicate the
corresponding Avastha of the Grah. The sub-state in the said
Avastha can be found out in the following way. Multiply the
figure (Sayan 1 to Nidr 12), denoted by the Avastha concerned,
by the same figure and increase it by the figure, denoted by the
Anka value for the first syllable of the native’s personal name.
Divide the product so obtained by 12. The remainder thereof
should be further increased by constant additives of the Grahas
in the following way: S&#363;rya 5, Candr 2, Mangal 2, Budh 3,
Guru 5, &#346;ukr 3, &#346;ani 3, Rahu (Ketu) 4. The product so
arrived at should be divided by 3. In the process of
calculation, if it happens, that the remainder is 1, it is
Drishti, if 2, it is Chesht and, if 0, it is Vichesht.</p>

<p>Notes. Shayan Adi are of supreme importance, as compared to
the other kinds of Avasthas.</p>

<p>In place of Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, given above, some
translators interpret the word A&#324;&#347;, as degree,
occupied by the Grah, which is obviously not correct. In this
connection the reader’s attention is drawn to Balabhadr’s Hora
Ratna, Ch. 3, wherein the author, Balabhadr himself, gives an
example for S&#363;rya, being in the 7<sup>th</sup>
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of Simh and thus he considered only 7, as
multiplier. He quotes Adhibhut Sagara, as his authority for
calculation of Sayan Adi.</p>

<p>Agaman Avastha is known, as Gamanechch by some exponents.</p>

<p>Anka value is 1 for a, ka, cha, &#7693; a, dha, bha and va, 2
for i, kha, ja, &#7693;ha, na, ma and sha, 3 for u, ga, jha, ta,
pa, ya and &#347;a, 4 for e, gha, &#7789; a, tha, pha, ra and
sa, 5 for o, ca, &#7789;ha, da, ba, la and ha.</p>

<p>38-39. Effects of Chesht etc. If the sub-state is Drishti in
an Avastha, the results, being stated for the Avastha, will be
medium, the effects will be full in Chesht and negligible in
Vichesht.  The good and bad effects of Grahas should be
deciphered, based on the strength and weakness of the Grahas. In
exaltation the Grahas reveal effects in a pronounced manner, due
to Avasthas.</p>

<p>40-51. Effects of S&#363;rya’s Avasthas. If S&#363;rya is in
Sayan Avastha, the native will incur digestive deficiency, many
diseases, stoutness of legs, bilious vitiation, ulcer in the
anus and heart strokes; if in Upavesan, will suffer poverty,
will carry loads, will indulge in litigations, be hard-hearted,
wicked and will lose in his undertakings; if is in Netrapani,
will always be happy, wise, helpful to others, endowed with
prowess and wealth, very happy and will gain royal favours; if
in Prakash, will be liberal in disposition, have plenty of
wealth, be a significant speaker in the assembly, will perform
many meritorious acts, be greatly strong and endowed with
charming beauty; if in Gaman, will be disposed to live in
foreign places, be miserable, indolent, bereft of intelligence
and wealth, be distressed, due to fear and will be
short-tempered; if in Agaman, will be interested in others’
wives, be devoid of his own men, be interested in movements and
skilful in doing evil deeds, be dirty, ill-disposed and will be
a talebearer; if in Sabh, will be disposed to help others, be
always endowed with wealth and gems, be virtuous, endowed with
lands, new houses and robes, be very strong, very affectionate
to his friends and very kindly disposed; if in Agam, will be
distressed, due to enemies, fickle-minded, evil-minded,
emaciated, devoid of virtuous acts and intoxicated with pride;
if in Bhojan, will experience pains in joints, will lose money
on account of others’ females, will have strength, declining off
and on, be untruthful, will incur head-aches, eat remnant food
and will take to bad ways; if in Nritya Lips, will be honoured
by the learned, be a scholar, will have knowledge of poetry etc.
and will be adored by kings on the earth; if is Kautuk, will
always be happy, will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge and will
perform Yagyas, will move amidst kings, have fear from enemies,
will be charming-faced and be endowed with knowledge of poetry;
if in Nidr, will have a strong tendency towards being drowsy,
will live in foreign (distant) places, will incur harm to his
wife and will face financial destruction. S&#363;rya in Upavesan
will make one an artisan, black in complexion, devoid of
learning and miserable. One will serve others. In Netrapani
there will be all kinds of happiness, if S&#363;rya is in Putr,
Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati. In other Bhavas Netrapani of S&#363;rya
will give eye diseases and enmity with all. If S&#363;rya is in
Prakash, the native will be meritorious, religious and liberal,
will enjoy pleasures, be equal to a prince and will enjoy the
status of Kuber, the God of wealth. However, the Prakash of
S&#363;rya, placed in Yuvati, or Putr will cause loss of the
first child and will produce many litigations. If S&#363;rya is
in Gaman, the native will incur disease of the feet and will be
very mean. If in Agaman, S&#363;rya in Vyaya, or in Yuvati will
destroy progeny and will give very limited wealth.  If in Agam,
S&#363;rya will give many miseries, an ugly appearance and
foolishness. However, he will give wealth. S&#363;rya in Bhojan
in Dharm will cause many hindrances to spiritual and religious
undertakings. In other Bhavas S&#363;rya in Bhojan will cause
head and ear diseases, apart from joint pains.  Though Maharishi
Parashar states, that the native with S&#363;rya in Kautuk
Avastha will have fear from enemies, Bal Bhadr exempts such evil
effect for the Ari Bhava position. S&#363;rya in Kautuk in other
Bhavas will give a number of daughters, two wives, itch,
excellence, liberality etc. If S&#363;rya is in Nidr, the native
will be predisposed to incur piles and elephantiasis, will
experience a lack of peace and he will be liable to lose his
first child.</p>

<p>52-63. Effects of Candr’s Avasthas. If Candr is in Sayan, the
native will be honourable, sluggish, given to sexual lust and he
will face financial destruction; if in Upavesan, will be
troubled by diseases, be dull-witted, not endowed with
mentionable wealth, will be hard-hearted, will do unworthy acts
and will steal others’ wealth; if in Netrapani, will be troubled
by great diseases (long lasting in nature), be very garrulous,
wicked and will indulge in bad deeds. Should Candr be in
Prakash, the native will be famous in the world, will have his
virtues exposed through royal patronage, will be surrounded by
horses, elephants, females and ornaments, will visit shrines. If
Candr is in Gaman with decreasing rays, the native will be
sinful, cruel and always troubled by afflictions of sight. If
Candr is in Gaman with increasing rays, the native will be
distressed, due to fear. If Candr is in Agaman, the native will
be honourable, will suffer diseases of the feet, will secretly
indulge in sinful acts, will be poor and devoid of intelligence
and happiness; if in Sabh, will be eminent among men, honoured
by kings and kings of kings, will be very beautiful, will subdue
the passion of women and will be skilful in sexual acts, will be
virtuous; if in Agam, will be garrulous and virtuous and, if the
said Candr is of dark fortnight, the native will have two wives,
he will be sick, highly wicked and violent; if in Bhojan, will
be endowed with honour, conveyances, attendants, social status,
wife and daughters, provided Candr is Full ‘Purna’; if in Bhojan
and is of dark fortnight, auspicious effects will fail to come;
if in Nritya Lips and is endowed with (fortnightly) strength,
will be strong, will have knowledge of songs and will be a
critic of beauty of things; if in Nritya Lips and of dark
fortnight, i.e. not endowed with strength, the person will be
sinful; if in Kautuk, the native will attain kingship, lordship
over wealth and skill in sexual acts and in sporting with
harlots. Should waxing Candr, being yuti with Guru, be in Nidr,
the native will be quite eminent. If waxing Candr is in Nidr,
but devoid of Guru’s Yuti, the native will lose his wealth on
account of females and female jackals will be crying around his
abode (as though it were a cemetery).</p>

<p>64 75. Effects of the Avasthas of Mangal.  If Mangal is in
Sayan, the native will be troubled by wounds, itch and ulcer. If
Mangal is placed in Upavesan, the native will be strong, sinful,
untruthful, eminent, wealthy and bereft of virtues. If Mangal is
placed in Lagn and happens to be in Netrapani, there will be
penury; if placed in other Bhavas, Netrapani will confer
rulership of a city. Should Mangal be in Prakash, the native
will shine with virtues and will be honoured by the king. Mangal
in Prakash in Putr will cause loss of children and of wife.  If
Mangal is in Prakash in Putr and happens to be there with Rahu,
a severe (positional) fall will descend on the native. Should
Mangal be in Gaman, the native will be always roaming, will have
fear of multiple ulcers, will incur misunderstandings with
females, will be afflicted by boils, itches etc. and will incur
financial decline. If Mangal happens to be in Agaman Avastha,
the native will be virtuous, endowed with precious gems, will
adore a sharp sword, will walk with the gait of an elephant,
will destroy his enemies and will remove the miseries of his
people. If Mangal is placed in Sabh and happens to be in
exaltation, the native will be skilful in conducting wars, will
hold the flag of righteousness aloft and will be wealthy; if
Mangal happens to be in Sabh in Putr, or Dharm, the native will
be bereft of learning; if Mangal is in Sabh in Vyaya,
childlessness and no wife and no friends will result; if Mangal
is in other Bhavas in Sabh, the native will be a scholar in a
king’s court (poet laureate), be very wealthy, honourable and
charitable. If Mangal is in Agam, the native will be devoid of
virtues and good deeds, will be distressed by diseases, will
acquire diseases of the root of the ears (‘Karan Mularogam’
&amp; ‘Padamulam Urumulam’ etc.) and severe gout pains, will be
timid and will befriend evil lot. If Mangal is with strength,
while in Bhojan Avastha, the native will eat sweet-food; if
devoid of strength, will indulge in base acts and be
dishonourable. If Mangal is in Nritya Lips, the native will earn
wealth through the king and will be endowed with fullness of
gold, diamonds and corals in his house; if in Kautuk, will be
curious in disposition and will be endowed with friends and
sons; if in Kautuk and simultaneously exalted, will be honoured
by the king and the virtuous and will be virtuous himself; if in
Nidr, will be short-tempered, devoid of intelligence and wealth,
will be wicked, fallen from virtuous path and troubled by
diseases. Should Mangal be in Upavesan in Lagn, the native will
be extremely sinful and he will incur several diseases, will be
indigent and not peaceful. If Upavesan occurs for Mangal in
Dharm, the native will lose his whole wealth apart from his wife
and progeny. Mangal in Netrapani in Lagn will give poverty and
will destroy the native’s wife and progeny; if Mangal is in
Netrapani in other Bhavas, this confers on the native all kinds
of wealth and happiness from wife and children. The Dhan, or
Yuvati position of Mangal in Netrapani will cause fear from
lions and snakes apart from giving earnings from lands.
Furthermore the native’s wife will predecease him. Should Mangal
be in Prakash in Putr, or in Yuvati, the native will lose his
wife and all children. If Mangal is placed in Putr in Prakash
and is yuti with &#346;ani, the native will kill cows. Should
Mangal be in Gaman in Lagn, the native will be active in his
assignments, will incur diseases of the joints, burning pains in
the eyes and will obtain dental afflictions and the like, he
will have fear from dogs and will adore the guise of a female.
In other Bhavas Mangal in Gaman will bring royal favours,
leadership and luxuries of life. Mangal in Agaman will cause
piles and diseases of the rectum. If Mangal is in Bhojan, or in
Sayan in Putr, or in Randhr, there will be untimely death for
the native. In other Bhavas Bhojan of Mangal will confer wealth.
Should Mangal be in Nritya Lips and happens to be in Lagn, Dhan,
Yuvati, or Karm, the native will receive all kinds of happiness;
there will be miseries in abundance, if Mangal is in Nritya Lips
and placed in Randhr, or Dharm, apart from incurring untimely
death. In other Bhavas Nritya Lips of Mangal will make the
native akin to Kuber. Mangal in Yuvati, or in Dharm in Kautuk
will give several diseases and death of the first child and
wife. In other Bhavas Kautuk will confer scholarship, various
kinds of wealth, two wives and more female children. In Nidr
Mangal in Lagn, Dhan, Sahaj, Dharm, Karm, or Labh will give
scholarship, foolishness and poverty. Putr, or Yuvati placement
of Mangal in Nidr will give many miseries and many male
children. Should Rahu join Mangal in Nidr in any Bhava, the
native will have many wives, be miserable and will suffer from
some diseases on the surface of the feet.</p>

<p>76-86. Effects of Budh’s Avasthas. Should Budh in Sayan be in
Lagn, the native will be lame and will have reddish eyes (like
the black bee); if Budh is in Sayan in other Bhavas, the native
will be addicted to licentious (disregarding certain rules)
pleasures and be wicked. If Budh is in Upavesan in Lagn, the
native will possess (the seven principle) virtues; if Budh in
Upavesan is in Lagn, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, or
Drishtis from malefics, or is yuti with malefics, penury will
result; if Budh in Upavesan is in Lagn, receiving a Drishti from
a benefic, or Drishtis from benefics, or is yuti with benefics,
financial happiness will follow. If Budh is in Netrapani, the
native will be devoid of learning, wisdom, well wishers and
satisfaction, but he will be honourable; if Budh is in Putr in
Netrapani, the subject will be bereft of happiness from wife and
sons, will be endowed with (more) female children and will gain
abundant finance through royal patronage.  If Budh is in
Prakash, the native will be charitable, merciful and
meritorious, he will cross the boundaries of ocean in respect of
many branches of learning, he will be endowed with the great
faculty of discrimination and will destroy evil people; if in
Gaman, will visit the courts of kings on many occasions and
Goddess Lakshmi will dwell in his abode; if in Agaman, the same
effects, due to his being in Gaman, will fructify; if in Sabh
and happens to be in exaltation, will be affluent and
meritorious at all times, will be equal to Kuber, or will be a
king, or a minister, will be devoted to Lord Vishnu and Lord
Shiva, will be virtuous and will attain full enlightenment.
Should Budh be in Agam, the native will serve base men and will
gain wealth thereby, will have two sons and one fame bringing
daughter. If Budh is in Bhojan, the native will face financial
losses through litigations, will physically lose on account of
fear from the king, will be fickle-minded and will be bereft of
physical and conjugal felicity; if in Nritya Lips, will be
endowed with honour, conveyances, corals (gems etc.), sons,
friends, prowess and recognition in assembly, due to his
scholarship; if Budh in Nritya Lips Avastha is in a malefic’s
R&#257;&#347;i, the native will be addicted to prostitutes and
will long for licentious pleasures. If Budh is in Kautuk in
Lagn, the native will be skilful in music; if Budh is in Yuvati,
or Randhr with Kautuk, the native will be addicted to
courtezans; if Budh in Kautuk is placed in Dharm, the native
will be meritorious and attain heavens after death. If Budh is
in Nidr, the native will not enjoy comfortable sleep, will be
afflicted by neck, or neck joint ‘Samadhi’ diseases, will be
devoid of co-born, afflicted by miseries galore, will enter into
litigations with his own men and will lose wealth and
honour.</p>

wealth on account of afflictions of the sense of sight (heavy
medical expenses, due to severe eye diseases); if Netrapani
occurs, when &#346;ukr is in other Bhavas, the native will own
large houses. Should &#346;ukr be in Prakash in its own
R&#257;&#347;i, in its exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, or in a
friendly R&#257;&#347;i, the native will sport, like a lofty

<p>123-134. Effects of Rahu’s Avasthas. If Rahu is in Sayan, the
native will experience miseries in abundance, but, if Rahu in
Sayan is placed in Vrishabh, Mithun, Kanya, or Mesh, the native
will be endowed with wealth and grains. If Rahu is in Upavesan,
the native will be distressed, due to ulcers, will be endowed

<p>135-146. Effects of Ketu’s Avasthas. If Ketu is in Sayan in

<p>147. General Effects (up to Sloka 155). O Brahmin, if a
benefic Grah is in Sayan, there will be benefic effects at all
times, according to the learned.</p>

<p>148. If a malefic is in Bhojan, everything will be destroyed
and there is no need of a second thought.</p>

<p>149. Should a malefic in Yuvati be in Nidr, auspicious
effects will follow, provided, that there is no Drishti from
another malefic.</p>

<p>150. Declare without a second thought auspicious effects,
following the location of a malefic in Putr Bhava, but only with
Nidr, or in Sayan.</p>

<p>151. Untimely death, due to royal wrath, will come to pass,
if there is a malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr, or in Sayan.</p>

<p>152. If in the case of a malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr, or
Sayan there happens to be a benefic Drishti, or the Yuti of a
benefic, (untimely) death will be in the river Ganges, i.e.
Gangetic belt, shrines etc.</p>

<p>153. If there is a malefic in Karm in Sayan, or Bhojan, the
native will face many miseries on account of his own deeds.</p>

<p>154. O excellent of the Brahmins, doubtlessly a Raj Yog will
come to pass, if Candr is in Karm in Kautuk, or Prakash.</p>

<p>155. Thus the good and bad effects should be guessed,
assessing the strength and weakness of the Grahas, concerning
all the Bhavas.</p>

<h2><a name=46>Ch. 46. Dashas of Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar!  You are
omniscient. There is no subject, with which you are not
conversant.  Therefore now please favour me with guidance about
the different kinds of Dashas (periods) of the various
Grahas.</p>

<p>2-5. Maharishi Parashar replied. O Brahmin!  Dashas are of
many kinds. Amongst them Vimshottari is the most appropriate for
the general populace. But the other Dashas, followed in special
cases, are Astottari, Shodshottari, Dwadashottari, Panchottari,
Shatabdik, Chaturashiti-sama, Dwisaptati-sama, Shastihayani,
Shat-trimshat-sama. Our ancients have described these different
kinds of Dashas, based on Nakshatras.</p>

<p>6-11. O Brahmin! Some Maharishis have made a mention of Kala
and Chakr Dasha, but they have recognized the Kala Chakr Dasha,
as supreme. The other kinds of Dashas, propagated by the sages,
are Char, Sthir, Kendr, Karak, Brahma Grah, Manduk, Shul,
Yogardh, Drig, Trikon, R&#257;&#347;i, Panchswara, Yogini, Pind,
Nausargik, Asht Varg, Sandhya, Pachak, Tara etc. But in our view
all these Dashas are not appropriate.</p>

<h3>Vimshottari</h3>

<p>12-14. Beginning from Kritika, the Lords of Dashas are
S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Rahu, Guru, &#346;ani, Budh, Ketu and
&#346;ukr in that order. Thus, if the Nakshatras from Kritika to
the Janm Nakshatr are divided by nine, the remainder will
signify the Lord of the commencing Dasha. The remaining Dashas
will be of the Grahas in the order, given above. In Kali Yuga
the natural life-span of a human being is generally taken, as
120 years. Therefore Vimshottari Dasha is considered to be the
most appropriate and the best of all Dashas.</p>

<p>15. The periods of Dashas of S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Rahu,
Guru, &#346;ani, Budh, Ketu and &#346;ukr are 6, 10, 7, 18, 16,
19, 17, 7 and 20 in that order.</p>

<p>16. To find out the remainder of the Dasha, operating at the
time of birth, first find out the expired portion of the Dasha
of the concerned Grah. This is done, as follows. Multiply the
Dasha period of the Grah concerned by the period of the stay of
Candr in Janm Nakshatr, that has expired and divide that amount
by the total period of the stay of Candr in that Nakshatr. The
figure in years, months etc. so arrived at will be the expired
period of the Dasha. If this figure is deducted from the total
period of the Dasha, we will get the balance of Dasha at the
time of birth.</p>

<h3>Ashtottari</h3>

<p>17-20. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin, the sages have
recommended the adoption of Ashtottari, when Rahu not being in
Lagn, in any other Kendr, or Trikon to the Lord of the Lagn.
From 4 Nakshatras from Ardra commences the Dasha of S&#363;rya,
from 3 after that begins the Dasha of Candr, 4 after that will
bring the Dasha of Mangal, 3 after that the Lord of Dasha will
be Budh, 4 therefrom will have &#346;ani, as the Dasha Lord, 3
thereafter the Lord will be Guru, Rahu will be the Lord of the
Dasha 4 Nakshatras after that and then &#346;ukr will take over
the lordship of the Dasha 3 Nakshatras from the last one
mentioned above. The Lord of the Dasha at birth will be
determined by counting in this order up to the Janm Nakshatr.
The duration of Ashtottari Dasha for S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal,
Budh, &#346;ani, Guru, Rahu and &#346;ukr are 6, 15, 8, 17, 10,
19, 12 and 21 in that order. Thus in this Dasha system only 8
Grahas play the role of Dasha Lords, Ketu having been denied
this privilege.</p>

<p>21-22. The Dashas of the various Grahas have been specified
above. In the case of malefic Grahas the Dasha span of one
Nakshatr is &frac14; of the Dasha of the Grah. It is
1/3<sup>rd</sup> in the case of benefics. Thus the expired
portion of the Dasha is calculated, according to the method,
followed for Vimshottari Dasha, by multiplying the Bhayat, i.e.
the expired period of the stay of Candr in the Janm Nakshatr, by
the Dasha portion of the Janm Nakshatr and dividing it by
Bhabhog, i.e. the total period of the stay of Candr in the Janm
Nakshatr. Then the balance of Dasha at birth can also be
ascertained. If Uttarashadha happens to be the Janm Nakshatr,
the duration of its first three Padas is taken, as Bhabhog and
the Dasha calculations should be done accordingly. The Dasha and
calculations for Abhijit Nakshatr are done by taking the
4<sup>th</sup> Pad of Uttarashadha plus the 15<sup>th</sup> part
of the beginning of Shravan. For Shravan the Bhabhog would be
the total of its duration in Ghatikas minus the
1/15<sup>th</sup> part of the beginning of Shravan.</p>

<h3>Shodshottari</h3>

<p>23. It will be advisable to adopt the Shodshottari, if the
birth is in the day in Krishna Paksh (dark half of the month),
or at night in Shukla Paksh (bright half).</p>

<p>24-26. The Dasha may be adopted, when the Lagn is in the Hora
of Candr with birth in the Krishna Paksh, or, when Lagn is in
the Hora of S&#363;rya with birth in the Shukla Paksh. Count the
number of Nakshatras from Pushya to the Janm Nakshatr. Divide
this number by 8. The remainder will indicate the Dashas of
S&#363;rya, Mangal, Guru, &#346;ani, Ketu, Candr, Budh and
&#346;ukr. The Dashas of the above Grahas are of 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17 and 18 years.</p>

<h3>Dwadashottari</h3>

<p>27-28. This Dasha system will be appropriate for one, whose
Lagn is in the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of &#346;ukr.  Count from
Janm Nakshatr to Revati. Divide this number by 8. The remainder
will indicate the Dasha of the Grah concerned. The Dasha order
is S&#363;rya, Guru, Ketu, Budh, Rahu, Mangal, &#346;ani, Candr.
The Dashas will be of 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 years of
the Grahas.</p>

<h3>Panchottari </h3>

<p>(29-30) This Dasha is considered suitable for those, whose
Lagn is Kark and also in the Kark Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347;.
Count from Anuradha up to the Janm Nakshatr and divide the
number by 7. The remainder will indicate the Dasha. The order of
the Dasha Lords is S&#363;rya, Budh, &#346;ani, Mangal,
&#346;ukr, Candr and Guru. The Dashas of the Grahas are 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 years.</p>

<h3>Shatabdik</h3>

<p>(31-32) This Dasha system has been considered appropriate, if
Lagn is Vargottama. This happens, when Lagn in the
R&#257;&#347;i Kundali and the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; Lagn are in
the same R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>(33-34) Count from Revati to the Janm Nakshatr and divide
this number by seven. The remainder will indicate the Lords of
Dashas in this order: S&#363;rya, Candr, &#346;ukr, Budh, Guru,
Mangal and &#346;ani. Their Dashas will be of 5, 5, 10, 10, 20,
20 and 30 years.</p>

<h3>Chaturashiti-sama</h3>

<p>35-36. Chaturashiti-sama Dasha is considered appropriate in
cases, where the Karm’s Lord is placed in Karm. Count from Swati
to the Janm Nakshatr and divide this number by 7. The remainder
will indicate the Dasha Lords in the following order:
S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani.
The Dasha period of each Grah is 12 years.</p>

<h3>Dwisaptati-sama</h3>

<p>37-39. This Dasha system is considered suitable in cases,
where the Lord of Lagn is in Lagn, or in Yuvati. Count from Mul
to the Janm Nakshatr and divide the number by 8. The remainder
will determine the Dasha Lords in the following order:
S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr, &#346;ani and
Rahu. In this Dasha system all the eight Grahas have Dashas of 9
years each.</p>

<h3>Shastihayani</h3>

<p>40-41. This Dasha may be adopted in cases, where S&#363;rya
is posited in Lagn. The order of Dasha Lords in this system is,
as follows: Guru, S&#363;rya, Mangal, Candr, Budh, &#346;ukr,
&#346;ani and Rahu. The following shows the Nakshatras, falling
under the various Dasha Lords. The Dashas of Guru, S&#363;rya
and Mangal are of 10 years. The remaining Grahas have Dashas of
6 years each. Guru (Ashvini, Bharani, Kritika, Punarvasu),
S&#363;rya (Rohini, Mrigashira, Ardra, U.Ashadha), Mangal
(Pushya, Aslesha, Magha, Revati), Candr (P.Phalguni, U.Phalguni,
Hast), Budh (Swati, Vishakah, Anuradha), &#346;ukr (Jyeshtha,
Mul, P.Ashadha), &#346;ani (Abhijit, Shravan, Dhanishtha), Rahu
(Shatabhisha, P.Bhadra, U.Bhadra).</p>

<h3>Shat-trimshat-sama</h3>

<p>42-43. Count from Shravan to the Janm Nakshatr and divide the
number by 8. The remainder 1 etc. will indicate the Dasha Lords,
whose order will be, as follows: Candr, S&#363;rya, Guru,
Mangal, Budh, &#346;ani, &#346;ukr and Rahu. Their Dashas will
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years. If the birth is during the
day and Lagn is in the Hora of S&#363;rya and, if the birth is
at night and Lagn is in the Hora of Candr, adoption of this
system would be preferable.</p>

<h3>Kaal</h3>

<p>44-49. 5 Ghatikas before the sight of the semi-disk of the
setting S&#363;rya and 5 Ghatikas after that and 5 Ghatikas
before and after the rising of S&#363;rya, that is 10 Ghatikas
in the evening and 10 Ghatikas in the morning, respectively. The
total period of both these Sandhyas (twilight) is said to be 20
Ghatikas. The 20 Ghatikas of the night have been given the name
Purna and the 20 Ghatikas of the day have been given the name
Mugdha. The Sandhya at the time of sunrise is called Khanda and
the Sandhya at the time of sunset is said to be Sudh. Both of
these Sandhyas are of 10 Ghatikas each. If the birth is in
Purna, or Mugdha, its past Ghatikas should be multiplied by 2
and the product should be divided by 15. The figure so arrived
at should be converted into years, months etc. By multiplying it
by the serial number of S&#363;rya and other Grahas in their
normal order, we will get the Kaal Dasha of these Grahas. If the
birth is during Sandhya, then its past Ghatikas should be
multiplied by 4 and the product divided by 15. The figure so
arrived at in terms of years, months etc. should be multiplied
by the serial number of S&#363;rya and the other Grahas to get
the Kaal Dasha of all the nine Grahas.</p>

<h3>Chakr</h3>

<p>50-51. If the birth is at night, the Dasha will commence from
Lagn R&#257;&#347;i. If the birth is during the day, the Dasha
will start from the R&#257;&#347;i, in which the Lord of Lagn is
placed.  If the birth is during Sandhya, the Dasha will begin
from the R&#257;&#347;i of the second Bhava. The Dasha of each
R&#257;&#347;i is 10 years. As it is the Dasha system of the 12
R&#257;&#347;is in the Zodiac, it has been named, as Chakr
Dasha.</p>

<h3>Kaal Chakr</h3>

<p>52-53. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin!  Now, after making
obedience to Lord Shiva, I shall describe the Kala Chakr Dasha.
Whatever was related by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvati, is being
explained by me for the use of sages to be utilized for the
welfare of the people.</p>

<p>54-55. By drawing vertical and horizontal lines, prepare 2
Kundalis, Savya and Apsavya, of 12 apartments (Kosthas) each.
From the second Kostha in each Kundali fix the R&#257;&#347;is
Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik,
Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen. Then Nakshatras may be incorporated
in the manner, indicated hereafter. These Kundalis, indicative
of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is, are called Kala Chakr.</p>

<p>56-58. Write Ashvini, Bharani and Kritika in the Savya Chakr
and Rohini, Mrigashira, Ardra in the Apsavya. Then incorporate
the three following Nakshatras, Punarvasu, Pushya and Aslesha in
the Savya and Magha, Purvaphalguni and Uttaraphalguni in the
Apsavya. Then incorporate the three following, Hast, Chitra and
Swati in the Savya and Vishakah, Anuradha and Jyeshtha in the
Apsavya. Then incorporate Mul, Purvashadha and Uttarashadha in
the Savya and Shravan, Dhanishtha and Shatabhisha in the
Apsavya. Finally incorporate the last three Nakshatras,
Purvabhadrapad, Uttarabhadrapad and Revati in the Savya Chakr.
Now there will be 15 Nakshatras in the Savya and 12 Nakshatras
in the Apsavya, (because for the 12 R&#257;&#347;is there are 12
Padas of 3 Nakshatras, the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;as). The Padas
of Ashvini, Punarvasu, Hast, Mul, Purvabhadrapad, Kritika,
Aslesha, Swati, Uttarashadha and Revati of the Savya should be
reckoned in the same manner, as the Padas of Ashvini.</p>

<p>59. Now I shall describe in detail, how the Deha and Jiva
should be reckoned in the Padas (quarters) of the
Nakshatras.</p>

<p>60. In the first Pad of Ashvini Mesh is indicative of Deha
(body) and Dhanu is indicative of Jiva (life). And the Lords of
Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik and
Dhanu are Lords of the Dashas in the order, as described
before.</p>

<p>61. In the second Pad of Ashvini Makar is Deha and Mithun is
Jiva and the Lords of the nine R&#257;&#347;is from Makar to
Mithun are Lords of the Dashas.</p>

<p>62. In the third Pad of the ten Nakshatras, beginning from
Ashvini, Vrishabh is Deha and Mithun is Jiva. The Lords of the
R&#257;&#347;is Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Mesh,
Vrishabh and Mithun are Lords of the Dashas in that order.</p>

<p>63-64. For the 4<sup>th</sup> Pad of the 10 Nakshatras,
beginning from Ashvini, Kark is Deha and Meen is Jiva and the
Lords of the nine R&#257;&#347;is from Kark to Meen are the
Lords of Dashas.</p>

<p>65. In the four Padas of the 5 Nakshatras, Bharani, Pushya,
Chitra, Purvashadha and Uttarabhadrapad, Deha and Jiva are the
same, as for Bharani.</p>

<p>66. In the first Pad of Bharani Vrischik is Deha and Meen is
Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Vrischik, Tula, Kanya,
Kark, Simh, Mithun, Vrishabh, Mesh and Meen are the Lords of
Dashas in this order.</p>

<p>67. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> Pad of Bharani Kumbh is Deha and
Kanya is Jiva and the Lords of Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Mesh,
Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh and Kanya are the Lords of Dashas
in that order.</p>

<p>68. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> Pad of Bharani Tula is Deha and
Kanya is Jiva and Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Tula, Vrischik,
Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen, Vrischik, Tula and Kanya are the
Dasha Lords in this order.</p>

<p>69. In the 4<sup>th</sup> Pad of Bharani Kark is Deha and
Kumbh is Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Kark, Simh,
Mithun, Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, Kumbh, Makar and Dhanu are the
Dasha Lords in this order.</p>

<p>71-72. O Brahmin! I have thus given you the description of
Savya Chakr. Now I shall give the description of Apsavya Chakr.
Prepare a similar chart of 12 apartments and from the
2<sup>nd</sup> apartment onwards place the R&#257;&#347;is from
Vrischik onwards in the reverse order.  In this chart Deha and
Jiva would be the same for Rohini, Magha, Vishakah and Shravan,
as for Rohini.</p>

<p>73-76. In the first Pad of Rohini Kark is Deha and Dhanu is
Jiva. The Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh,
Meen, Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Simh and Tula will be the Dasha
Lords in this order. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> Tula will be Deha and
Kanya the Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Kanya, Tula,
Vrischik, Meen, Kumbh, Makar, Dhanu, Vrischik and Vrischik will
be the Dasha Lords. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> Kumbh will be Deha and
Kanya Jiva. The Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Kanya, Simh, Kark,
Mithun, Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Makar and Kumbh will be the Dasha
Lords. In the 4<sup>th</sup> Vrischik will be Deha and Meen Jiva
and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Meen, Mesh, Vrishabh,
Mithun, Simh, Kark, Kanya, Tula and Vrischik will be the
Lords.</p>

<p>77. In the 4 Padas of the Apsavya Nakshatras Mrigashira,
Ardra, Purvaphalguni, Uttaraphalguni, Anuradha, Jyeshtha,
Dhanishtha and Shatabhisha the Deha and Jiva and the Dasha Lords
will be the same, as for Mrigashira.</p>

<p>78-81. In the first Pad of Mrigashira Kark is Deha and Meen
is Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Meen, Kumbh, Makar,
Dhanu, Vrischik, Tula, Kanya, Simh and Kark will be the Dasha
Lords in this order. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> Vrishabh is Deha and
Mithun is Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Mithun,
Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh, Meen, Mesh and Vrishabh
will be the Dasha Lords. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> Makar is Deha and
Mithun is Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Mithun,
Simh, Kark, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, Meen, Kumbh and Makar will be
the Dasha Lords. In the 4<sup>th</sup> Mesh will be Deha and
Dhanu Jiva and the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is Dhanu, Vrischik,
Tula, Kanya, Simh, Kark, Mithun, Vrishabh and Mesh will be the
Dasha Lords.</p>

<p>82. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! The description of
the Deha and Jiva of the Padas of the Apsavya Nakshatras and the
Dasha Lords is the same, as narrated by Lord Mahadeva to Goddess
Parvati.</p>

<p>83. Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar! Now please
guide me about the Dasha spans of the Dasha Lords, described by
you. Please also demonstrate, how the commencement of the Dasha,
its expired and the remaining periods at the birth are to be
calculated.</p>

<p>84. Maharishi Parashar said. 5, 21, 7, 9, 10, 16 and 4 years
are the Dasha spans of S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru,
&#346;ukr and &#346;ani.</p>

<p>85-86. The span of life of a person is determined from the
Padas (A&#324;&#347;as) of the Nakshatr at the time of birth, or
the time of query and the years allotted to the 9
R&#257;&#347;is, commencing from it (the Pad of the Nakshatr).
Some sages are of the view, that the person will enjoy full span
of life (Purna Ayu), if his birth is at the commencement of the
Padas, will have middle span of life (Madhaya Ayu), if the birth
is in the middle of the Padas and short span of life (‘Alap
Ayu’), or will face death-like sufferings, if the birth is at
the end of the Padas of the Nakshatr.</p>

<p>87-88. According to this principle, we should be acquainted
with the Padas of the Nakshatras. Now I shall tell you, how the
calculations are made, according to the proportion of the Padas
of a Nakshatr. The number of Ashvini etc., whichever may be the
past Nakshatras, should be divided by 3. Thereafter the
remainder should be multiplied by 4. To the figure so made
available the Pad of the present Nakshatr should be added.  The
product will be the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; from Mesh onwards.</p>

<p>89. The number of years (Purna Ayu) are, as under. For the
A&#324;&#347; in Mesh 100 years, in Vrishabh 85 years, in Mithun
83 years, in Kark 86 years. The number of years will be the same
for R&#257;&#347;is, situated the 5<sup>th</sup> and
9<sup>th</sup> to them.</p>

<p>90-91. Multiply the past Ghatikas, Palas etc. of the Pad of
the Nakshatr, in which a person is born, by the existing Dasha
years and divide it by 15. The result will indicate the expired
period of the Dasha in years, months etc. By deducting it from
the total number of years allotted, we get the balance of Dasha
at birth. The Dasha should be taken, as commencing from that
R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>92. Multiply the past Ghatikas, Palas etc.  of the present
Pad of the Nakshatr by the number of years and divide the
product by the fourth part of Bhabhog. The years etc. so
obtained may then be deducted from the total Dasha period. The
result will be the balance of Dasha at birth in years, months
etc.</p>

<p>93. The past Kalas (minutes) of the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, in
which Candr may be placed, should be multiplied by the years,
allotted to the Dasha and the product should be divided by 200.
The resulting years etc. will be the expired portion of the
Dasha. By deducting them from the total number of years the
balance of the Dasha at birth is obtained.</p>

<p>94-95. In the Savya Chakr the first A&#324;&#347; is called
Deha and the last Jiva. The opposite is the case in the Apsavya
Chakr. Therefore the calculations should be based on the Deha
etc. in the Savya Chakr and on the Jiva etc. in Apsavya.</p>

<p>We give below the Savya and Apsavya Kaal Chakr Charts. For
Example. The birth is in Mrigashira 4<sup>th</sup> Pad. It is in
the Apsavya Kaal Chakr. The Lord of Deha is Mangal and that of
Jiva is Guru. The Bhabhog of Mrigashira is 59/31 (59 Ghatikas 31
Palas) and Bhayat is 58/15 (58 Ghatikas 15 Palas). &frac14; of
the Bhabhog comes to 14/52/44. That would be the value of one
Pad. Multiplying this by 3 will get Ghatikas of 3 Padas, namely
44/38/15. Deducting this from Bhayat, the past Ghatikas, Palas
etc. of the 4<sup>th</sup> Pad will be 13/36/45. The full Dasha
years are 100.  Multiplying this by 13/36/45 we get
1300/3600/4500 = 1361/15. This divided by 15 will give the
expired period at birth, namely 90 years and 9 months. See the
Kaal Chakr. There we count from Jiva etc. to Deha. In the
4<sup>th</sup> Pad of Mrigashira Jiva is in Dhanu and Deha in
Mesh. Therefore, by deducting the total of years from Dhanu to
Mithun, namely 77, from 90 years 9 months, we get the expired
period of Vrishabh, namely 13 years and 9 months. By deducting
this from the present 16 years of &#346;ukr, we will get 2 years
and 3 months, as the balance of Dasha at birth. Accordingly,
like Vimshottari Dasha, the order of Dasha will be Vrishabh,
Mesh, Dhanu, Vrischik etc.</p>

<p>For Example. Suppose, that at the time of birth of a person
in Kritika Nakshatr the longitude of Candr (Candr Spast) is
1<sup>r</sup>4°50’.  This converted into Kalas will be 2090 at
birth. The Dasha should be taken, as commencing from that.
Divide the Kalas by 800 (1 Nakshatr). The result will be the
2<sup>nd</sup> Nakshatr, namely Bharini and the remainder will
be 490.  These will be the past Kalas of Kritika. There are 200
Kalas in one Pad (Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;). Divide 490, the past
Kalas of Kritika, by 200. We will then get 2, as past Padas and
the remainder 90 will represent the past Kalas of the present
Nakshatr. By multiplying this by 83, the Dasha years, we will
get 7470, which, divided by 200, will indicate the expired
portion of the Dasha, as 37 years, 4 months and 6 days. By
deducting the years of Deh&#257;&#324;&#347;, commencing from
Vrishabh, in the order Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen, Kumbh (16+7+10+4 =
37), we will get 0 years, 4 months and 6 days. This will be the
expired portion of Makar. Deducting this from 4, the Dasha
period of Makar, we get the balance of the Dasha of Makar,
namely 3 years, 7 months and 24 days. See in this connection the
Savya Kaal Chakr.</p>

<h3>Gati of R&#257;&#347;is in the Kaal Chakr</h3>

<p>96-98. There are three kinds of movements (Gati) of the
R&#257;&#347;is in the Kaal Chakr, namely Manduki, Markati and
Simhavlokan. The movement of one R&#257;&#347;i by jumping over
one R&#257;&#347;i is known, as Manduki Gati. Backward movement
to the previous R&#257;&#347;i is called Markati Gati. The
movement of a R&#257;&#347;i to the 5<sup>th</sup> and
9<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i is said to be Simhavlokan.</p>

<p>99-100. Movement from Kanya to Kark and from Simh to Mithun
is Manduki Gati. Movement from Simh to Kark is Markati Gati.
Movement from Meen to Vrischik and from Dhanu to Mesh is called
Simhavlokan Gati.</p>

<h3>Effects of Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is, as a Result of these
Gati</h3>

<p>101-102. The effects of the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is with
Manduki Gati in the Savya Chakr are distress to friends,
relations, parents and elders and there is likely to be cause
for trouble from poison, weapons, thieves and enemies. In the
Manduki Dasha of the Gati of a R&#257;&#347;i from Simh to
Mithun there is the likelihood of the death of the mother, or
self, trouble from Government and possibility of brain
fever.</p>

<p>103. The effects of the Dasha of R&#257;&#347;i with Markati
Gati in the Savya Chakr are loss of wealth, agricultural
products and animals, death of father, or an elderly close
relation and feeling of lethargy.</p>

<p>104-105. The effects of the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is with
Simhavlokan Gati in the Savya Chakr are possibility of injury
from animals, loss of amity with friends, distress to near
relations, drowning in a well, fall from animals, possibility of
harm from poison, weapons and diseases and destruction of
residential dwelling.</p>

<p>106-108. In the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is with the Manduki
Gati in the Apsavya Chakr the effects will be distress to wife
and conditions, loss of children, possibility of feverish
conditions and loss of position. In the Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;is with the Markati Gati there may be danger from
watery places, loss of position, distress from father,
punishment from Government and wandering in the forests; with
the Simhavlokan there may be destruction of the dwelling and
death of father etc.</p>

<p>109-111. If the movement is from Meen to Vrischik, the native
may suffer from fever; if from Kanya to Kark, there may be loss
of brothers and kinsmen; if from Simh to Mithun, there may be
ill health of the wife; if from Simh to Kark, the native may
die; if from Dhanu to Mesh, there may be death of uncles and
similar relations. If the R&#257;&#347;i is yuti with a malefic,
adverse conditions may be expected in the Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i. Favourable effects will be felt in its Dasha, if
the R&#257;&#347;i is yuti with a benefic.</p>

<p>112-113. O Brahmin! In the Kaal Chakr Dasha favourable and
unfavourable effects may be predicted, after taking into account
the directions of the R&#257;&#347;is and Grahas.</p>

<p>114-119. If the movement is from Kanya to Kark, good results
are realized in places, located in the East and at that time
journeys to the places in the North prove fruitful. Unfavourable
effects will be felt in places, located in the West and the
South. It will be advisable not to undertake journeys in those
directions in the Dasha of these R&#257;&#347;is. If the
movement is from Simh to Mithun, no journey should be undertaken
to places, located in the East. However, the journeys to the
South-West will prove fruitful in the Dasha of those
R&#257;&#347;is. If the movement is from Kark to Simh, journeys
during that period to the South will prove unfavourable and
result in loss and the native has to return from the South to
the West. If the movement is from Meen to Vrischik, there will
distress, if the native goes to the North. The same would
happen, if the movement is from Dhanu to Makar. There may be ill
health, imprisonment, or death, if the movement is from Dhanu to
Mesh. There may be gains, comforts and property and marriage, if
the movement is from Dhanu to Vrischik. It will not be advisable
to undertake journeys to the West during the related period, if
the movement is from Simh to Kark. Favourable results should be
predicted, if the R&#257;&#347;is are yuti with benefics and
adverse, if the R&#257;&#347;is are yuti with malefics.</p>

<p>120-122. According to the above-mentioned Kaal Chakr, the
person, born in the A&#324;&#347;as of the various
R&#257;&#347;is, will be, as under. Mesh A&#324;&#347; brave and
a thief, Vrishabh wealthy, Mithun learned, Kark king, Simh
respected by king, Kanya learned, Tula minister, or adviser,
Dhanu sinful, Kumbh businessman, Meen wealthy.</p>

<p>123-128. If the Deha, or Jiva R&#257;&#347;is are yuti with
S&#363;rya, Mangal, &#346;ani, or Rahu, the native will die.
Worse results may be expected, if the Deha and Jiva
R&#257;&#347;is are yuti with two, or all of them. If there is a
malefic in Deha R&#257;&#347;i, the native suffers ill health; a
malefic in a Jiva R&#257;&#347;i will make the native very
timid. If the Deha and/or Jiva R&#257;&#347;i are yuti with two
malefics, there will be distress and diseases.  Three malefics
in the Deha and/or Jiva R&#257;&#347;i will cause premature
death. Four malefics in the Deha and Jiva R&#257;&#347;i will
cause definite death. If both the Deha and Jiva R&#257;&#347;is
are occupied by malefics, there will be fear from king and
thieves and death of the native. If S&#363;rya is in the Deha,
or Jiva R&#257;&#347;i, there will be danger from fire. Candr in
the Deha, or Jiva R&#257;&#347;i will cause danger from water,
Mangal fear from weapons, Budh fear from windy troubles,
&#346;ani fear from Gulma (a disease), Rahu and Ketu fear from
poison. If the Deha, or Jiva R&#257;&#347;is are occupied by
Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr, the native will be wealthy, will enjoy
all kinds of comforts and will have good health. Mixed results
may be expected, if the Deha and Jiva R&#257;&#347;is are
occupied by both benefics and malefics.</p>

<p>129-130. In the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is, owned by
malefics, the body and soul will be in distress. The effects
will be favourable in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is, owned by
benefics. If a malefic R&#257;&#347;i is occupied by a benefic
Grah, or, if a benefic R&#257;&#347;i is occupied by a malefic
Grah, the effects will be of a mixed nature.</p>

<h3>Effects of Kaal Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;is in Lagn
and other Bhavas.</h3>

<p>131-132. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i in
Lagn the body remains healthy and the native spends a life with
many kinds of comforts. If the Lagn R&#257;&#347;i is a benefic
one, the good effects are realized fully. If the Lagn
R&#257;&#347;i is a malefic R&#257;&#347;i, there is likelihood
of ill health. If a Grah in exaltation, or in its own
R&#257;&#347;i occupies Lagn, the native is respected by the
king, or government and acquires wealth.</p>

<p>133-134. In the Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i in Dhan the
native receives good food, enjoys happiness of wife and
children, gains wealth, achieves progress in the educational
sphere, becomes a clever conversationalist and moves in good
society. If the R&#257;&#347;i be a benefic, good effects are
realized in full, otherwise the effects would be of a mixed
nature.</p>

<p>135-136. Happiness from co-borns, valour, patience, comforts,
acquisition of gold, ornaments and clothes and recognition by
the king, or government, are the effects in the Kaal Chakr Dasha
of the R&#257;&#347;i in Sahaj. If the R&#257;&#347;i is a
benefic, the good results are realized in full, otherwise
adverse effects may also be experienced.</p>

<p>137-138. Good relations with kinsmen, acquisition of land,
houses, or a kingdom, conveyances and clothes and enjoyment of
sound health, are the effects of the Chakr Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i in Bandhu. If the R&#257;&#347;i is a benefic
one, the good effects are realized in full. If it is a malefic
R&#257;&#347;i, adverse results are also experienced.</p>

<p>139-140. Being blessed with wife and children, favours from
Government, enjoyment of sound health, good relations with
friends, achievement of fame, good progress in the educational
sphere, patience and valour are the effects of the Chakr Dasha
of the R&#257;&#347;i in Putr. If the R&#257;&#347;i is a
benefic one, the good results are enjoyed in full. If the
R&#257;&#347;i is a malefic one, adverse effects are also
experienced.</p>

<p>141-142. Danger from the king, fire and weapons and the
possibility of suffering from diabetes, Gulma and jaundice are
the effects in the Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i in Ari. If
the R&#257;&#347;i is a malefic one, the above adverse effects
will be experienced in full. There will be some mitigation of
the evil effects in the case of a benefic R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>143-144. Marriage, conjugal happiness, being blessed with
children, gain of agricultural products, cows and clothes,
favours and recognition from the king and achievement of fame,
are the effects in the Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i in
Yuvati. The beneficial results will be experienced in full, if
the R&#257;&#347;i is a benefic one. Meagre good effects will be
realized in the case of a malefic R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>145-146. Destruction of a residential house, distress, loss
of wealth, poverty and danger from enemies are the effects of
the Chakr Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i in Randhr. The adverse
effects will be realized in full, if the R&#257;&#347;i is a
malefic one. Some mitigation in evil effects may be expected in
the case of a benefic R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>(147-157) …</p>

<h3>…Char</h3>

<p>158-166. Now I will tell you about the working out of the
Dasha years of Vrischik and Kumbh. If both the Lords of the two
R&#257;&#347;is, Vrischik and Kumbh, are placed in their own
R&#257;&#347;is, their Dasha will be of 12 years. Otherwise the
Dasha will be of the number of years, indicated by the number,
counted from that R&#257;&#347;i to the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied
by its Lord. If one Grah be in his own R&#257;&#347;i and the
other in any other R&#257;&#347;i, the Dasha will be of the
number of years counted, from the above first R&#257;&#347;i to
the other. If the Lords are in different R&#257;&#347;is, the
counting is to be done up to the R&#257;&#347;i, which is
stronger. The R&#257;&#347;i, which has a Grah, placed in it, is
considered more powerful than the R&#257;&#347;i without a Grah
in it. If both are with Grahas in them, the one with more Grahas
would be considered more powerful. If both R&#257;&#347;is are
occupied by an equal number of Grahas, the strength of the
R&#257;&#347;i itself should be taken into account. The
principle for considering the Bal of the R&#257;&#347;i is, that
the Fixed R&#257;&#347;i is considered stronger than the Movable
one and the Dual R&#257;&#347;i is considered more powerful than
the Fixed R&#257;&#347;i. If there is equality in the strength
of the R&#257;&#347;is, then to determine the number of years of
Dasha counting should be done up to the R&#257;&#347;i with
bigger number. If one R&#257;&#347;i is occupied by a Grah in
exaltation, the counting should be done up to that
R&#257;&#347;i only.  In addition 1 should be added in the
number of years in the case of a R&#257;&#347;i with an exalted
Grah and 1 should be deducted from the number of years in the
case of a R&#257;&#347;i with a Grah in debilitation. The
prediction should be made after calculating the Dashas in this
manner.</p>

<p>167. If the R&#257;&#347;i in Dharm Bhava is in an odd Pad,
the counting should be from the R&#257;&#347;i in the Lagn
onwards. The counting would be in the reverse order, if the Pad
is even. The Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is have to be fixed, keeping
this in view.</p>

<p>For Example. In the above Tula is the R&#257;&#347;i in Dharm
Bhava in an odd Pad. Amongst the Lords of Lagn, &#346;ani and
Rahu, Rahu is associated with a Grah. Therefore Rahu is more
powerful than, &#346;ani. Therefore counting should be done up
to Rahu. Kumbh is in even Pad, therefore counting has to be done
from Kumbh up to Rahu in the reverse order, by which the Char
Dasha for Kumbh would come to 8 years. Mesh is in odd Pad.
Therefore the Char Dasha for Mesh will be one year. The Dasha of
other R&#257;&#347;is should be calculated in the same
manner.</p>

<h3>Sthir</h3>

<p>168-169. Maharishi Parashar said. Now I am going to describe
the Sthir Dasha. In this Dasha system 7, 8 and 9 years are the
Dasha spans of the Movable (Char), Fixed (Sthir) and Dual
(Dvisva Bhava) R&#257;&#347;is. In this system the Dasha of the
12 R&#257;&#347;is begins from the Brahm Grah Ashrit
R&#257;&#347;i. The Dashas are counted onwards from the odd
R&#257;&#347;is and in the reverse order from the even
R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>170-173. Maitreya said. O great Sage! Now please enlighten me
how the Brahm Grah is picked out in a chart. Maharishi Parashar
said. From amongst the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya the Grah,
who may possess the greatest strength and is placed in Lagn, or
in Yuvati with strength, the one, placed in an odd
R&#257;&#347;i within sixth Bhava from the Bhava concerned, is
called the Brahm Grah. The Lord of Randhr in Randhr is also
accepted, as Brahm Grah. If &#346;ani, or Rahu/Ketu obtain
Brahmatva (qualifications of Brahm Grah), they become Brahm
Grah. If a number of Grahas obtain Brahmatva, the one with the
largest number of degrees would become Brahm Grah. If there is
parity in the degrees of such Grahas, the most powerful amongst
them would become Brahm Grah.</p>

<h3>Yogardha</h3>

<p>174. The spans of Dashas of the R&#257;&#347;is in the
Yogardha Dasha system are half of the total of the spans of Char
and Sthir Dashas. The Dasha will commence from the
R&#257;&#347;i of Lagn, or Yuvati, whichever is stronger. The
order of the Dashas of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is will be counted
onwards, if the opening Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is an odd one. If
it be an even R&#257;&#347;i, the Dashas will be in reverse
order.</p>

<h3>Kendradi</h3>

<p>175-176. In this system there are Dashas of Fixed
R&#257;&#347;is in the Kendr etc. from Lagn, or from Yuvati,
whichever is stronger. If Lagn, or Yuvati with strength is
placed in an odd R&#257;&#347;i, the Kendr etc. are counted in
the onward order. If it be in an even R&#257;&#347;i, the
counting will be in the backward, or reverse order. In them also
the Dashas would be in the order of comparative strength of the
R&#257;&#347;is. The order of Dashas would be the same, as
reckoned from the Atma Karak. The spans of Dashas would be the
same, as they are in the Char Dasha. In calculating the years of
Dashas of Grahas, counting is done from the Grah to his own
R&#257;&#347;i. The years of Dashas would be the number, arrived
at by counting up to the R&#257;&#347;i of the Grah, which is
stronger, or more in number.</p>

<p>177. If a Grah owns two R&#257;&#347;is, the Dasha years will
be equal to the number, which is greater, when counted from the
R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by him.</p>

<p>Notes. Under this system Dashas are of two kinds, namely Lagn
Kendradi and Atma Karak Kendradi. There are also Kendradi
R&#257;&#347;i Dasha, or Kendradi Grah Dasha in both the Dasha
systems, mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Karak</h3>

<p>178. The system, under which the first Dasha is of the Atma
Karak and the subsequent Dashas are of the remaining 7 Karakas
in their order is known, as Karak Dasha. In this system the
Dasha years are equal to the number of R&#257;&#347;is, counted
from Lagn up to the Karak concerned.</p>

<h3>Manduk</h3>

<p>179-180. Under the Manduk Dasha system the Dasha commences
from Lagn, or Yuvati Bhava, whichever is stronger. If the
R&#257;&#347;i of commencement is an odd R&#257;&#347;i, the
Dashas of 3 Movable, 3 Fixed and 3 Dual R&#257;&#347;is will be
counted in the onwards order. They will be in the reverse order
in the case of an even R&#257;&#347;i.  In this system the Dasha
years will be the same, as in Sthir Dasha. In this system every
Dasha is of the next 3<sup>rd</sup> R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<h3>Shula</h3>

<p>181-182. Some sages have designed the Shula Dasha for
determining the time of death. In this system the Dasha
commences from Dhan, or Randhr, whichever is stronger. If the
R&#257;&#347;i is an odd one, the order of the Dasha
R&#257;&#347;is will be onwards. It will be backwards in the
case of an even R&#257;&#347;i. The Dasha years in this system
are, as adopted for the Sthir Dasha. There is a possibility,
that death appears in the Dasha of the Marak R&#257;&#347;i,
which has greater strength.</p>

<h3>Trikon</h3>

<p>183-184. In this system the first Dasha commences from the
strongest amongst the R&#257;&#347;is in Kon (Trikon) to Lagn
(Tanu, Putr and Dharm). This system is similar to the Char
Dasha. Here also the Dashas of the R&#257;&#347;is will be in
the onwards order in the case of odd R&#257;&#347;is and in the
reverse order in the case of even R&#257;&#347;is. The Dasha
years will be similar to that of Char Dasha. It has been named
Trikon because of the commencement of the Dasha from the
R&#257;&#347;is in Konas.</p>

<h3>Dirga</h3>

<p>185-187. In this system the order of the Dashas is, as
follows: the R&#257;&#347;i, occupying Dharm, the
R&#257;&#347;is, receiving a Drishti from the R&#257;&#347;i in
Dharm, the R&#257;&#347;i in Karm, the R&#257;&#347;is,
receiving a Drishti from the R&#257;&#347;i in Karm, the
R&#257;&#347;i in Labh and the R&#257;&#347;is, receiving a
Drishti from the R&#257;&#347;i in Labh. As this system is
mostly based on Drishtis, it has been named, as Dirga Dasha.
Three different processes are adopted for the Movable, Fixed and
Dual R&#257;&#347;is from Dharm, Karm and Labh. According to
them, R&#257;&#347;i, which receives a Drishti from the Movable
R&#257;&#347;i, is counted backwards and the R&#257;&#347;i,
receiving a Drishti from the Fixed R&#257;&#347;i, is counted
onwards. In the case of the Dual R&#257;&#347;i, if it is odd,
the counting is onwards and the order is backwards in case of an
even R&#257;&#347;i for the R&#257;&#347;is, receiving a
Drishti.</p>

<p>Notes. The intention is, that from the point of view of
Drishti the process of R&#257;&#347;i, receiving a Drishti,
should be started from the R&#257;&#347;i, which is nearest. In
this connection readers may refer to R&#257;&#347;i
Drishtikathan Adhyaya, Ch. 8, Verse 9 and the table after
that.</p>

<h3>Lagnadi R&#257;&#347;i Dasha</h3>

<p>188-189. In this system there are Dashas of all the 12
R&#257;&#347;is, including Lagn, in every Nakshatr. Consequently
the Bhayat at birth may be multiplied by 12 and then the product
should be divided by Bhabhog. The R&#257;&#347;i, degree etc. so
available may be added to the longitude of Lagn. From the
R&#257;&#347;i, becoming available by doing so, will start the
Dashas of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is. (If that R&#257;&#347;i is
odd, the counting will be onwards. It will be in the reverse
order, if the R&#257;&#347;i is even)</p>

<p>190. For finding the balance of Dasha at birth, multiply the
expired degree etc. by the Dasha years of the first Dasha
R&#257;&#347;i and divide it by 30. The years etc. so arrived at
may be deducted from the Dasha years. The result will indicate
the balance of Dasha at birth in years, months etc.</p>

<h3>Panch Swar Dasha</h3>

<p>191-194. Beginning from Akaradhi 5 Swaras (a, i, u, e, o),
write underneath them the Varnas in 6 lines. Leave out the
letters ‘&#328;a’, ‘&ntilde;a’ and ‘&#326;a’, because they are
not used in names. If they are found in any name, ‘ga’ may be
substituted for ‘&#328;a’, ‘ja’ for ‘&ntilde;a’ and ‘da’ for
‘&#326;a’ for working out the Dashas and making predictions. In
this manner the Swar, under which the first Varna of the name of
the native is found, will determine the order of the Dashas of
the five Swaras. Dashas are of 12 years for all the five Swaras.
In the Dasha of every Swar there will be Antar Dashas of all the
five Swaras in the same order.</p>

<h3>Yogini</h3>

<p>195-199. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already
given you the description of Panch Swar Dasha. Now I will
acquaint you with the Yogini Dasha, as described by Lord
Mahadeva. There are 8 Yoginis, namely Mangal, Pingal, Dhanya,
Bhramari, Bhadrika, Ulka, Siddha and Sankat.</p>

<p>Candr, S&#363;rya, Guru, Mangal, Budh, &#346;ani, &#346;ukr
and Rahu are born from them. Add 3 to the Janm Nakshatr and
divide it by 8. The remainder will indicate the Yogini Dasha of
Mangal, etc. The Dashas are of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years.
The balance of Dasha at birth should be worked out from the
Bhayat and Bhabhog etc., as already explained earlier.</p>

<h3>Pind, A&#324;&#347; and Nisarg</h3>

<p>201-202. The Pind, A&#324;&#347; and Nisarg Dasha will be the
same, as Pindayu, A&#324;&#347;ayu and Nisargayu, the method of
determination of which has already been explained previously.
The order of Dashas will be, as follows. The first will be of
Lagn, S&#363;rya, or Candr, whoever is stronger. The subsequent
Dashas will be of Grahas in Kendr to them, then of Grahas in
Panaphara Bhavas and lastly in Apoklima Bhavas. The Dashas and
Antar Dashas of Lagn and the seven Grahas will also be in the
same order.</p>

<p>203. The effects of these Dashas will be in accordance with
Ashtak Varg Bal, which subject will be dealt with later. These
Dashas are also called Ashtak Varg Dashas.</p>

<h3>Sandhya</h3>

<p>204. Sandhya is the Dvadash&#257;&#324;&#347; Ayurdaya of the
Param Ayurdaya (maximum possible life-span). In Sandhya Dasha
the Dasha of all the R&#257;&#347;is from Lagn onwards is of
1/12 the years of Param Ayurdaya.</p>

<h3>Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha</h3>

<p>205-206. By multiplying the Dasha years of Sandhya Dasha by 6
and dividing the product by 31, the years, months etc. so
arrived at may be put in one apartment of a Table. Thereafter
half of these years, months etc. may be written in the next
three apartments. The remaining 8 apartments may be filled in by
one third of the aforesaid years, months etc. In this manner
Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha of every Bhava can be worked out
and predictions may be made from it.</p>

<h3>Tar</h3>

<p>207-209. O Brahmin! Some sages have given consideration to
Tar Dasha, which is like Vimshottari. In this Dasha Janm, Sampat
etc. in their order replace S&#363;rya, Candr etc., placed in
Kendras.  This Dasha is applied in those cases only, where there
are Grahas in Kendras.  If there are a number of Grahas, the
first Dasha will belong to the strongest amongst them.</p>

<p>210. O Brahmin! I have now completed the description of the
different kinds of Dashas. I will give the description of their
Antar Dashas (sub-periods) later.</p>

<h2><a name=47>Ch. 47. Effects of Dashas</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya said. O Maharishi Parashar! You have told me
about the different kinds of Dashas. Now be kind enough to
enlighten me with the effects of Dashas.</p>

<p>2. Maharishi Parashar replied. O Brahmin!  There are two
kinds of effects of Dashas: general and distinctive. The natural
characteristics of the Grahas cause the general effects and the
distinctive effects are realized by their placements etc.</p>

<p>3-4. The effects of the Dashas of the Grahas are in
accordance with their strength. The effects of a Grah in the
first Dreshkan are realized at the commencement of the Dasha.
The Grah in the second Dreshkan makes its effects felt in the
middle of the Dasha. The effects of the Grah in the third
Dreshkan are experienced at the end of the Dasha. If the Grah is
retrograde, these effects would be in the reverse order. The
Dasha effects of Rahu and Ketu, who are always retrograde, will
always be realized in the reverse order.</p>

<p>5-6. The effects are favourable, if at the commencement of
the Dasha the Dasha Lord is in Lagn, in his exaltation, own, or
a Shant R&#257;&#347;i. The results are unfavourable, if the
Dasha Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, in his
debilitation, or in an inimical R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>7-11. During the Dasha of S&#363;rya there is acquisition of
wealth, great felicity and honours from the Government, if at
the time of birth S&#363;rya is in his own R&#257;&#347;i, in
his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, in a Kendr, in Labh, be
associated with the Lord of Dharm, or the Lord of Karm and
strong in his Varg. The native will be blessed with a son
(children), if S&#363;rya is with the Lord of Putr. The native
will acquire elephants and other kinds of wealth, if S&#363;rya
is associated with the Lord of Dhan. The native will enjoy
comforts of conveyances, if S&#363;rya is associated with the
Lord of Bandhu. He attains a high position, like that of Army
Chief, by the beneficence of the king and enjoys all kinds of
happiness.  Thus during the Dasha of a strong (and favourable)
S&#363;rya there are acquisitions of clothes, agricultural
products, wealth, honours, conveyances etc.</p>

<p>12-15. During the Dasha of S&#363;rya there will be
anxieties, loss of wealth, punishment from Government,
defamation, opposition by kinsmen, distress to father,
(in)auspicious happenings at home, distress to paternal and
maternal uncles etc., anxiety and inimical relations with other
people for no reason whatsoever, should S&#363;rya be in his
R&#257;&#347;i of debilitation, be weak in Ari, Randhr, or
Vyaya, or be associated with malefic Grahas, or with the Lord of
Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya.  There will be some favourable effects at
times, if in the above situations S&#363;rya receives a Drishti
from benefic Grahas. The effects will always be unfavourable,
when malefic Grahas give a Drishti to S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>16-22. O Brahmin! After describing the effects of the Dasha
of S&#363;rya in brief, I will now come to the effects of
Vimshottari Dasha of Candr. During the Dasha of Candr from its
commencement to the end there will be opulence and glory, good
fortune, gain of wealth, auspicious functions at home, dawn of
fortune, attainment of a high position in Government,
acquisition of conveyances, clothes, birth of children and
acquisition of cattle, should Candr be in her exaltation, in her
own R&#257;&#347;i, in Kendr, in Labh, Dharm, or Putr, be
associated with, or receives a Drishti from benefics, be fully
powerful and is associated with the Lord of Karm, Dharm, or
Bandhu. There will be extraordinary gains of wealth and
luxuries, if such a Candr is in Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>23-26. Should Candr be waning, or in her debilitation
R&#257;&#347;i, there will be loss of wealth in her Dasha. If
Candr is in Sahaj, there will be happiness off and on. If Candr
is associated with malefics, there will be idiocy, mental
tension, trouble from employees and mother and loss of wealth.
If waning Candr is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or is associated
with malefics, there will be inimical relations with Government,
loss of wealth, distress to mother and similar evil effects. If
a strong Candr is placed in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya there will be
troubles and good times off and on.</p>

<p>27-32. If Mangal is in his exaltation, in his Multrikon, in
his own R&#257;&#347;i, in Kendr, in Labh, or Dhan Bhava with
strength, in a benefic A&#324;&#347; (Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;) and
is associated with a benefic, there will be during his Dasha
acquisition of kingdom (attainment of a high administrative, or
political position in Government, gain of wealth and land,
recognition by Government), gain of wealth from foreign
countries and acquisition of conveyances and ornaments. There
will also be happiness and good relations with co-borns. If
Mangal with strength is placed in a Kendr, or in Sahaj, there
will be gain of wealth through valour, victory over enemies,
happiness from wife and children. There will, however, be a
possibility of some unfavourable effects at the end of the
Dasha.</p>

<p>33. If Mangal is in his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, weak, in
an inauspicious Bhava, or is associated with, or receives a
Drishti from malefics, there will be in his Dasha loss of
wealth, distress and similar unfavourable effects.</p>

<p>34-39&frac12;. In order to clarify the effects of the Dasha
of Rahu I shall first mention the exaltation and debilitation
R&#257;&#347;is of Rahu and Ketu. The exaltation R&#257;&#347;i
of Rahu is Vrishabh. The exaltation R&#257;&#347;i of Ketu is
Vrischik. The Multrikonas of Rahu and Ketu are Mithun and Dhanu.
The own R&#257;&#347;is of Rahu and Ketu are Kumbh and Vrischik.
Some sages have expressed the view, that Kanya is the own
R&#257;&#347;i of Rahu and Meen is the own R&#257;&#347;i of
Ketu. Should Rahu be in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i etc.,
there will be during the Dasha of Rahu great happiness from
acquisition of wealth, agricultural products etc., acquisition
of conveyances with the help of friends and Government,
construction of a new house, birth of sons (children), religious
inclinations, recognition from Government of foreign countries
and gain of wealth, clothes etc. If Rahu be associated with, or
receives a Drishti from benefics, be in a benefic R&#257;&#347;i
and be in Tanu, Bandhu, Yuvati, Karm, Labh, or Sahaj, there will
be during his Dasha all kinds of comforts by the beneficence of
the Government, acquisition of wealth through a foreign
Government, or sovereign and felicity at home.</p>

<p>40-43. If Rahu is in Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be
during his Dasha all kinds of troubles and distress. If Rahu is
associated with a malefic, or a Marak Grah, or is in his
debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, there will be loss of position,
destruction of his residential house, mental agony, trouble to
wife and children and misfortune of getting bad food. There will
be loss of wealth at the commencement of the Dasha, some relief
and gain of wealth in his own country and distress and anxieties
during the last portion of the Dasha.</p>

<p>44. Now I am going to describe the effects of the Dasha of
Guru, the great benefic and preceptor of the Gods.</p>

<p>45-48. If Guru is in his exaltation, his own R&#257;&#347;i,
his Multrikon, in Karm, Putr, or Dharm Bhava, in his own
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;, or in his exalted Nav&#257;&#324;&#347;,
there will be during his Dasha: acquisition of kingdom, great
felicity, recognition by Government, acquisition of conveyances
and clothes, devotion to deities and Brahmins, happiness in
respect of his wife and children and success in the performance
of religious sacrifices (oblations).</p>

<p>49-51. If Guru is in his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i,
combust, associated with malefics, or in Ari, or Randhr, there
will be during his Dasha loss of residential premises, anxiety,
distress to children, loss of cattle and pilgrimage. The Dasha
will give some unfavourable effects at its commencement only.
During the later part of the Dasha there will be good effects,
like gain of wealth, awards from and recognition by
Government.</p>

<p>52. Now I will describe to you the effects of the Dasha of
&#346;ani, who is considered the vilest and most inferior
amongst all the Grahas.</p>

<p>53-56. If &#346;ani is in his exaltation, in his own
R&#257;&#347;i, or in Multrikon, or friendly R&#257;&#347;i, in
his own, or exalted Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; and in Sahaj, or Labh,
there will be during his Dasha recognition by Government,
opulence and glory, name and fame, success in the educational
sphere, acquisition of conveyances and ornaments etc., gain of
wealth, favours from Government, attainment of a high position,
like Commander of an Army, acquisition of a kingdom, benevolence
of goddess Lakshmi, gain of property and birth of children.</p>

<p>57-60. If &#346;ani is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, in his
debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, or combust, there will be during
his Dasha ill effects from poison, injury from weapons,
separation from father, distress to wife and children, disaster,
as a result of displeasure of Government, imprisonment etc. If
&#346;ani receives a Drishti from, or is associated with a
benefic, is placed in a Kendr, or in a Trikon, in Dhanu, or in
Meen, there will be acquisition of a kingdom, conveyances and
clothes.</p>

<p>61. Now I am going to describe the effects of the Dasha of
Budh, who is called a Kumar (in his teens) amongst all the
Grahas.</p>

<p>62-65. If Budh is in his exaltation, in his own, in a
friendly R&#257;&#347;i, or in Labh, Putr, or Dharm, there will
be during his Dasha acquisition of wealth, gain of reputation,
improvement in knowledge, benevolence of Government, auspicious
functions, happiness from wife and children, good health,
availability of sweetish preparations, profits in business etc.
If Budh receives a Drishti from a benefic, is in Dharm, or is
the Lord of Karm, the aforesaid beneficial results will be
experienced in full and there will be great felicity
all-round.</p>

<p>66-70. If Budh is associated with a malefic, there will be
during his Dasha punishment by Government, inimical relations
with kinsmen, journey to a foreign country, dependence on others
and the possibility of urinary troubles. If Budh is in Ari,
Randhr, or Vyaya, there will be loss of wealth, due to
indulgence in lascivious activities, possibility of suffering
from rheumatism and jaundice, danger of thefts and malevolence
of Government, loss of land and cattle etc. At the commencement
of the Dasha of Budh, there will be gains of wealth, betterment
in the educational sphere, birth of children and happiness. In
the middle of the Dasha, there will be recognition from
Government. The last part of the Dasha will be distressful.</p>

<p>71. Now I will tell you about the Dasha of Ketu, who is a
headless trunk (Kabandha) amongst all the Grahas.</p>

<p>72-77. If Ketu is in a Kendr, a Trikon, or in Labh, in a
benefic R&#257;&#347;i, in his exaltation, or in his own
R&#257;&#347;i, there will be during his Dasha cordial relations
with the king, desired headship of a country, or village,
comforts of conveyances, happiness from children, gain from
foreign countries, happiness from wife and acquisition of
cattle. If Ketu is in Sahaj, Ari, or Labh, there will be in his
Dasha acquisition of a kingdom, good relations with friends and
opportunities for the acquisition of elephants. At the
commencement of the Ketu Dasha there will be Raj Yog. During the
middle portion of the Dasha there will be possibilities of
fearfulness and in the last part there will be sufferings from
ailments and journeys to distant places. If Ketu is in Dhan,
Randhr, or Vyaya, or receives a Drishti from a malefic, there
will be imprisonment, destruction of kinsmen and residential
premises and anxieties, company of menials and diseases.</p>

<p>78. Now I will describe the effects of the Dasha of
&#346;ukr, who is the incarnate of intoxication, ecstasy,
delight and pride amongst all the Grahas.</p>

<p>79-82. If &#346;ukr is in his exaltation, in his own
R&#257;&#347;i, or in a Kendr, or a Trikon, there will be during
his Dasha acquisition of fancy clothes, ornaments, conveyances,
cattle and land etc., availability of sweet preparations every
day, recognition from the sovereign, luxurious functions of
songs and dances etc. by the benevolence of Goddess Lakshmi. If
&#346;ukr is in his Multrikon, during his Dasha there will
definitely be acquisition of a kingdom, acquisition of a house,
birth of children and grandchildren, celebration of marriage in
the family, attainment of a high position, like the Commander of
an Army, visits of friends, recovery of lost wealth, property,
or kingdom.</p>

<p>83-84&frac12;. If &#346;ukr is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya,
there will be during his Dasha inimical relations with kinsmen,
distress to wife, losses in business, destruction of cattle and
separation from relations.</p>

<p>85-87. If &#346;ukr is in Bandhu, as Lord of Dharm, or Karm,
there will be during his Dasha attainment of rulership of a
country, or village, performance of pious deeds, like building
of reservoirs and temples and giving grains etc. in charity,
availability of sweet preparations every day, vigor in work,
name and fame and happiness from wife and children.</p>

<p>88-89. Similar are the effects of &#346;ukr in his
sub-periods. If &#346;ukr is Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati, there will
be during his Dasha physical pains and troubles. To get
alleviation from those troubles the native should perform
Shatarudriya, or Mrityunjaya Japa in the prescribed manner and
give in charity a cow, or female buffalo.</p>

<h2><a name=48>Ch. 48. Distinctive Effects of the Nakshatr Dasha, or of the
Dashas of the Lords (Vimshottari) of various Bhavas</a></h2>

<p>1. If the Lord of Karm is placed in an auspicious Bhava in
his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i etc., his Dasha effects will be
favourable. The effects will be adverse, if the Lord of Karm is
in his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i and occupies an inauspicious
Bhava. This proves, that an inauspicious Grah in his exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i etc. will not produce unfavourable results, if
placed in an auspicious Bhava and a benefic, being in his
debilitation R&#257;&#347;i and being placed in an inauspicious
Bhava, will produce adverse effects. Now I will describe the
effects of the Dasha of the Lords of various Bhavas, who are
related to each other.</p>

<p>2-4. There will be physical well-being in the Dasha of the
Lord of Lagn, distress and possibility of death in the Dasha of
the Lord of Dhan, unfavourable effects in the Dasha of the Lord
of Sahaj, acquisition of house and land in the Dasha of the Lord
of Bandhu, progress in educational sphere and happiness from the
children in the Dasha of the Lord of Putr and danger from
enemies and ill health in the Dasha of the Lord of Ari.</p>

<p>5-8. There will be distress to wife and the possibility of
the death of the native in the Dasha of the Lord of Yuvati, the
possibility of death and financial losses in the Dasha of the
Lord of Randhr, improvement in the educational sphere,
religious-mindedness and unexpected gains of wealth in the Dasha
of the Lord of Dharm, recognition from and awards by the
Government in the Dasha of the Lord of Karm, obstacles in gains
of wealth and the possibility of diseases in the Dasha of the
Lord of Labh and distress and danger from diseases in the Dasha
of the Lord of Vyaya. A Grah, placed in an auspicious Bhava,
like Trikon etc., at the commencement of the Dasha, produces
favourable results in his Dasha. The Grah, placed in Ari,
Randhr, or Vyaya at that time, yields only adverse results
during his Dasha. It is therefore essential, that the placement
of a Grah at the time of birth and at the commencement of the
Dasha should both be taken into account for the assessment of
the Dasha effects.</p>

<p>14-17&frac12;. The Dasha of Ari’s, Randhr’s, or Vyaya’s Lord
also becomes favourable, if they get associated with the Lord of
a Trikon. If the Lord of a Kendr is in a Trikon, or the Lord of
a Trikon is in a Kendr, the Dasha of the Grah, yuti with either
of them, becomes favourable. The Dasha of a Grah, receiving a
Drishti from the Lord of a Kendr, or Trikon is also favourable.
If Dharm’s Lord is in Lagn and Lagn’s Lord is in Dharm, the
Dashas of both of them will produce extremely beneficial
results.  There will be acquisition of a kingdom in the Dashas
of Lagn’s Lord and Karm’s Lord, if Karm’s Lord is in Lagn and
Lagn’s Lord is in Karm.</p>

<p>18-20. The Dasha of Sahaj’s, Ari’s and Labh’s Lord, of the
Grahas, placed in Sahaj, Ari and Labh and of the Grahas, yuti
with the above, will prove unfavourable. The Dasha of the
Grahas, associated with the Lords of Marak Bhavas, namely Dhan
and Yuvati, in Dhan, or Yuvati and the Dashas of the Grahas,
placed in Randhr, will produce unfavourable effects. Thus the
Dashas should be considered favourable, after taking into
account the placement of a Grah and his relationship of one Grah
with the other. (Rahu and Ketu give favourable results in Sahaj,
Ari and Labh).</p>

<h2><a name=49>Ch. 49. Effects of the Kaal Chakr</a></h2>

<p>1-5. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I am now going to
describe to you the effects of the Kaal Chakr Dasha.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, owned, or occupied by
S&#363;rya, there will be ill health, due to the blood, or bile

acquisition of wealth and birth of children; … Guru, there will
be increase in the number of children, acquisition of wealth and

<h3>The Effects of the Dashas on the Basis of the
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of each R&#257;&#347;i</h3>

<p>6-7. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha of Mesh in Mesh
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; there will be distress, due to troubles,
caused by the pollution of blood. In the Dasha of Mesh in the

in the Kanya distress to wife, in the Tula kingship, in the
Vrischik death and in the Dhanu acquisition of wealth. Such will
be the effects of the 9 Padas of Mesh. In assessing the net
effects the nature of the Grah, occupying the R&#257;&#347;i,
should also be taken into account. </p>

<p>8-10. In the Dasha of Makar Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; in Vrishabh
there will be tendency to perform undesirable deeds along with
more adverse effects. In the Kumbh Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; there

Dasha of Dhanu A&#324;&#347; increase in the stock of weapons,
in the Dasha of Vrishabh A&#324;&#347; injury by some weapon and
in the Dasha of Mithun A&#324;&#347; enjoyment.</p>

<p>13-15. In Kark in the Dasha of Kark A&#324;&#347; there will

<p>16-17. In Simh in the Dasha of the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of
Vrischik there will be distress and disputes, … Tula
extraordinary gains, … Kanya gains of wealth, … Kark danger from
wild animals, … Simh birth of a son, … Mithun increase of
enemies, … Vrishabh gains from sale of cattle, … Mesh danger
from animals and in the Dasha of Meen A&#324;&#347; journeys to

mingling with kinsmen, … Mesh happiness from mother, … Vrishabh
birth of children, … Mithun increase in enemies, … Kark love
with some woman, … Simh aggravation of diseases and in the Dasha
of Kanya A&#324;&#347; birth of children.</p>

<p>20-22. In Tula in the Dasha of Tula A&#324;&#347; there will
be financial gains, … Vrischik good relations with kinsmen, …
Dhanu happiness from father, … Makar disputes with mother, …
Kumbh birth of a son and financial gains, … Meen entanglement
with enemies, … Vrischik disputes with women, … Tula danger from
water and in Dasha of Kanya A&#324;&#347; more financial

<p>23-24&frac12;. In Vrischik in the Dasha of Kark A&#324;&#347;
there will be financial gains, … Simh opposition to the king, …
Mithun acquisition of land, … Vrishabh financial gains, … Mesh

sources, … Vrischik fever, … Dhanu more enemies, … Makar

Kaal Chakr, prepared on the basis of Pad of the Janm Nakshatr,
the Dashas of the Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; R&#257;&#347;is and
their duration can be assessed and prediction can be made for
the whole life of the native.  Appropriate remedial measures
(recitation of Mantras, oblations etc.) should be taken to
alleviate the adverse effects, caused by malefic Dashas.</p>

<p>35-37. The effects of Dasha in Raj Yog etc.  have already
been described in Vol. I of this book. The same should be
applied in a judicious manner in the Kaal Chakr. These are in
brief effects of Kaal Chakr Dasha.</p>

<h2><a name=50>Ch. 50. Effects of the Char etc. Dashas</a></h2>

<p>1-3. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already
described the Char etc. Dashas. Now I am going to tell you the
effects of these Dashas. The effects of the Dashas of the
R&#257;&#347;is should be judged from the strength of the Lords
of R&#257;&#347;is and whether they are benefics, or malefics.
If the Lord of a R&#257;&#347;i possesses full strength, the
effects of the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i will be realized in
full. The effects of the Dasha will be of medium nature, if the
strength is medium. If the Lord of R&#257;&#347;i possesses
little strength, the effects will be experienced
accordingly.</p>

<p>4-10. If there are malefics in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the
5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> from a Dasha
R&#257;&#347;i, the effects of the Dasha of that R&#257;&#347;i
will be distressful. If there are malefics in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
and the 6<sup>th</sup> from a Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, the effects
of the Dasha will be victory over enemies and happiness. If
there are benefics in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup>
from the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, there will be defeat in its
Dasha. If there are benefics, or malefics in the 11<sup>th</sup>
from the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, there will be conquests and
happiness in the Dasha. If the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is occupied
by, or is owned by a benefic, the effects of its Dasha will be
beneficial. If a Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, owned by a benefic, is
occupied by a malefic, favourable effects will be experienced in
the first part of the Dasha and they will be adverse in the
latter part. If a Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, owned by a malefic is
occupied by a benefic, the effects of the Dasha will be the
same. A Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, owned and occupied by a malefic
will always yield unfavourable results. The reverse will be the
case in the case of the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, owned and occupied
by a benefic. If a Dasha R&#257;&#347;i, owned by a benefic, is
occupied by both benefic and malefic Grahas, the effects of
Dasha will be adverse in its first part and favourable in the
latter part.</p>

<p>11-17. The assessment of the effects of the Dasha of the
Dasha R&#257;&#347;i should be made after taking into account
the disposition of the Grahas in the R&#257;&#347;i at birth and
the disposition of Grahas during the Dasha. If the Dasha
R&#257;&#347;i is well disposed both at the time of birth and
during its Dasha, the beneficial results will be realized in
full. If it is ill-disposed during the Dasha, the effects will
be of mixed nature. If the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is ill-disposed
both at the time of birth and during its Dasha, only evil
effects will be experienced.</p>

<p>18-19. The effects of the Dasha will be favourable, if it is
occupied by a benefic and there is also a benefic in the
R&#257;&#347;i previous to it. If the R&#257;&#347;i is occupied
by a malefic, the effects will be of adverse nature. If there
are benefics in Putr and Dharm, the effects of its Dasha will be
favourable. The reverse will be the case, if Putr and Dharm are
occupied by malefics.</p>

<p>20-21. Kumbh, Vrishabh, Simh and Vrischik are Badhak Bhavas
for the four Movable R&#257;&#347;is: Mesh, Kark, Tula and
Makar. In other words the 11<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i to a
Movable R&#257;&#347;i is its Badhak Bhava. If there is a
malefic in the Bhava, occupied by its Lord, or in Badhak Bhava
of that R&#257;&#347;i, there will be occasions of great sorrow,
imprisonment and diseases during the Dasha.</p>

<p>22. The Dasha of a R&#257;&#347;i will be favourable, if it
is occupied by its own Lord, or an exalted Grah. The Dasha of a
R&#257;&#347;i, not occupied by any Grah, will be adverse.</p>

<p>23-25. There will be great danger, imprisonment during a
journey, displeasure of Government and danger from enemies in
the Dasha and Antar Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, from which its
Badhak Bhava, Vyaya, Ari and Randhr are occupied by Rahu. There
will be loss, due to the displeasure of the king and danger
therefrom in the Antar Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, that is
occupied by S&#363;rya, Mangal, Rahu and &#346;ani. There will
be the possibility of death, if the 5<sup>th</sup> and the
9<sup>th</sup> from the Antar Dasha R&#257;&#347;i are occupied
by a debilitated, or malefic Grah.</p>

<p>26-28. There will be enjoyment, acquisition of chiefship of a
town, or village, birth of a son, financial gains, well-being,
dawn of fortune, attainment of the position of a Commander of an
Army and progress all-round, if there is an exalted Grah in the
Trikon from the Antar Dasha R&#257;&#347;i. There will be in his
Dasha financial gains, well-being and birth of a son, if the
Grah, who is the Lord of the Dasha, happens to be in a benefic
R&#257;&#347;i and receives a Drishti from Guru.</p>

<p>29-32. Vrishabh, Tula, Makar, Kumbh and Mithun are the
inimical R&#257;&#347;is of S&#363;rya. The inimical
R&#257;&#347;is of Candr and other Grahas may be reckoned
similarly. If a Grah is in an inimical R&#257;&#347;i, his Dasha
will be full of adversities. The effects of the Dasha of
R&#257;&#347;is and Grahas should be judged after taking into
account the above rules.</p>

<p>33-34. The Dashas of that Grah will be favourable, who is Raj
Yog Karak, who is disposed between two benefics (that is there
are benefics in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup>
Bhavas to that Grah) and who has benefics in the 2<sup>nd</sup>,
3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Bhavas from him. A malefic
Grah becomes favourable, if he is disposed between benefics.</p>

<p>35-36. The whole of the Dasha of a Grah, who is related to a
friendly and benefic Grah at the commencement and the end of the
Dasha, will be favourable. In an unfavourable Dasha the Antar
Dasha of a benefic (Grah, or R&#257;&#347;i) becomes favourable.
The Dasha of a Grah, or R&#257;&#347;i, who has benefics in the
5<sup>th</sup>, or the 9<sup>th</sup> from it, is also
favourable. In this manner the effects of the Dasha should be
judged, after taking into account the dispositions of the Grah,
or R&#257;&#347;i at the commencement and at the end of the
Dasha.</p>

<p>37-39. The Dasha of the Grahas and R&#257;&#347;is, who have
benefics in the Trikon from them is favourable. If the Dasha of
a benefic R&#257;&#347;i commences in a benefic R&#257;&#347;i,
it will be very favourable. If an evil Dasha commences in a
benefic R&#257;&#347;i, it is also favourable. Therefore the
commencement of a Dasha should always be kept in view in
assessing the results of the Dasha. There will be loss of
fortune, if at the commencement of the Dasha there is a malefic
R&#257;&#347;i, or, if the Lord of the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is
in debilitation.</p>

<p>40-41. There will be loss of fortune, wealth and agricultural
products and infliction with disease during the Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by a debilitated Grah, or, if there is
a debilitated Grah in the 5<sup>th</sup> from it, or in the
9<sup>th</sup> from it, or whose Lord is debilitated, or related
to a debilitated Grah.</p>

<p>42. Four R&#257;&#347;is from Kumbh and four R&#257;&#347;is
from Vrischik belong to Rahu and Ketu, respectively. If Rahu and
Ketu are in any one of the aforesaid R&#257;&#347;is, the Dasha
will be productive of beneficial results.</p>

<p>43-45. If a Grah, whose Dasha is otherwise considered
favourable, is placed in a Marak Bhava, or, if the
R&#257;&#347;i, in which his Dasha comes to an end, receives a
Drishti from &#346;ukr, or Candr, there will be in his Dasha
displeasure of government and loss of wealth.</p>

<p>46-47. There will be loss of everything, imprisonment, death,
exile from the country and great distress at the end of the
Dasha of Rahu. The above effects will definitely be realized, if
there are malefics in the 5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup>
from Rahu. Beneficial and adverse effects should be predicted in
this manner.</p>

<p>48-50. The same would be the effects in the Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by malefics, like Rahu etc. The
association of a Marak Grah with the R&#257;&#347;i at the time
of commencement of its Dasha is not productive of good effects.
If such a Grah is Rahu, there will be imprisonment, or loss of
wealth.</p>

<p>51-52. The natural characteristics of the Bhava, occupied by
Rahu, are harmed at the commencement of the Dasha. If such a
Bhava is Dhan, there will be loss of wealth. If Candr and
&#346;ukr are in Vyaya, there will be losses, due to the
displeasure of government. If Mangal and Ketu are so disposed,
there will be death, or danger from fire. There will be
acquisition of a kingdom, if &#346;ukr and Candr are in Dhan at
the commencement of the Dasha. This means, that the effects of
the Bhava, in which Candr and &#346;ukr are placed at the
commencement and end of a Dasha, are strengthened. Thus their
disposition in Ari, Randhr and Vyaya will produce only adverse
effects.</p>

<p>53-55. Similarly the sages have described the effects of the
Bhava with Argal. If there is an auspicious Argal causing
benefic, or malefic Grah of a R&#257;&#347;i and Lagn receives a
Drishti from him, that R&#257;&#347;i will prevail. Here Lagn is
the secondary condition. If the Grah, causing uninterrupted
Argal, gives a Drishti to a R&#257;&#347;i, that R&#257;&#347;i
will prevail. In other words good effects will be derived in the
Dasha of that R&#257;&#347;i. The Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i,
which does not receive a Drishti from an auspicious Argal, or
the Dasha of a R&#257;&#347;i with Vipreet Argal will not be
favourable. The Dasha of that R&#257;&#347;i, which receives a
Drishti from a benefic, will be favourable.</p>

<p>56-59. Financial gains will be derived in the Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i, which is occupied by its benefic Lord, or by an
exalted Grah, who receives a Drishti from him. There will be
loss of wealth, if such a Grah is in the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava
to the R&#257;&#347;i (or Bhava). There will be destruction of
all good effects, distress to children and father and mental
agony in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, if there are malefics
in the 5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> from the
R&#257;&#347;i.  Evil effects will be experienced in the Dasha
of the R&#257;&#347;i, which is occupied by Randhr’s Lord,
Vyaya’s Lord, S&#363;rya, Mangal, or &#346;ani.</p>

<p>60-63. The Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i will cause distress to
children, exile to a foreign country and continuous disturbances
in life, if Rahu and Ketu are in the Trikon to the
R&#257;&#347;i.  There will be danger from enemies, from the
king and disease in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, which is so
posited, that the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 8<sup>th</sup> from it
are occupied by malefic, debilitated, or combust Grahas. There
will be destruction of house, land and agricultural fields, if
there is a malefic, or debilitated Grah in the 4<sup>th</sup>
from the R&#257;&#347;i. There will be loss of house, due to
negligence, if such a Grah is Mangal. There will be heart pain
and danger from government, if the Grah is &#346;ani and there
will be losses all round and danger from poison and thieves, if
the Grah is Rahu.</p>

<p>64-66&frac12;. There will be pilgrimage to holy places in the
Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, who has Rahu in the 10<sup>th</sup>
to it. There will be gain of earnings, religious rites, gain of
wealth, renown for good deeds and success in efforts and
ventures in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, which is so
posited, that the 10<sup>th</sup>, the 11<sup>th</sup> and the
9<sup>th</sup> from it are occupied by benefics. There will be
birth of children, happiness from wife and recognition by the
Government in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, from which the
5<sup>th</sup>, the 7<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> are
occupied by benefic, or exalted Grahas. During the Dasha of the
Bhavas (R&#257;&#347;is), occupied by Putr’s, Labh’s, Karm’s,
Bandhu’s, Dharm’s and Lagn’s Lord, there will be growth of these
Bhavas. The good effects will be in proportion to the strength
of the Bhavas and the Grahas, occupying them.</p>

<p>67-70. In the Dasha of a R&#257;&#347;i (Bhava) there will be
well-being, increase in opulence and glory and devotion to
deities and Brahmins, if it is occupied by Guru, &#346;ukr, or
the Lord of a Trikon. There will be acquisition of more
conveyances and cattle etc. in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i
(Bhava), which is so posited, that the 4<sup>th</sup> from it is
occupied by an exalted Grah, or Lord of a Trikon. Candr there
will give things, like grains, Gh&#299; etc. Full Candr will
favour with a treasure and jewels etc. &#346;ukr there, will
provide enjoyment from music etc.</p>

<p>71-72. There will be enjoyment of the palanquin-like
conveyance in the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i (Bhava), from
which the 4<sup>th</sup> is occupied by Guru. There will be
success in all ventures, great opulence and glory, acquisition
of a kingdom during the Dasha of a R&#257;&#347;i (Bhava), which
has the Yog of the Lord of Lagn, Dharm’s Lord, Karm’s Lord, an
exalted Grah, or benefics. The effects of the Dashas of various
Bhavas should be judged in this manner.</p>

<p>73-77. The effects of the Dashas of each R&#257;&#347;i, or
Grah (Nakshatr Dasha) depend on their 18 different kinds of
conditions. They are deep exaltation, exaltation, dispositions
on their either side, Multrikon, own, Adhimitr, Tatkalik
Mitra’s, neutral, enemy’s, Adhisatru’s R&#257;&#347;i, deep
debilitation, debilitated, or enemy’s Varg, own Varg,
disposition in a Kendr, disposition in a Trikon, defeated in war
between Grahas, deep combustion.</p>

<p>78-83&frac12;. Acquisition of kingdom, enjoyment and
acquisition of more property are the effects of the whole Dasha
of the Grah, who is in deep exaltation and is fully equipped
with all the six kinds of strength, great opulence and glory
with some possibility of affliction with disease are the effects
of the Grah, placed in his R&#257;&#347;i of exaltation. The
Dasha of a Grah in deep debilitation is called Rikt. Diseases,
loss of wealth and danger of death are the effects of the Dasha
of such a Grah.  The Dasha of the Grah, who is in a condition in
between deep exaltation and deep debilitation is known, as
Avrohini (descending). The Dasha of the Grah in exaltation, or
in a friend’s R&#257;&#347;i is called Madhya (of middle order).
This Dasha also yields moderately good effects. The Dasha of a
Grah, placed in a condition in between deep debilitation and
deep exaltation, is called Rohini (ascending). The Dasha of a
Grah, placed in between the debilitated and enemy
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; is called Adham (evil). Dangers of various
kinds, distress and sorrows are the results of the Dasha of such
a Grah. These Dashas give results, according to their
nomenclature.</p>

<p>84-87. The Dashas of other Grahas become auspicious and
augment the fortune, if the Lord of Dharm and Guru are in any
way related with Yog, Kendr, or the Bhava concerned etc. The
Grah with Yog of good fortune at birth produces good effects,
when he is free from retrogression and becomes direct. The
weakness, inabilities and Yogas of other Grahas should also be
taken into account in judging their effects. All those Dashas
give full, medium and little effects in accordance with the
disposition of the Grahas in the Kendr, Panaphara and
Apoklima.</p>

<p>88-89&frac12;. The Grahas in Shirshodaya, Ubhayodaya and
Prishthodaya R&#257;&#347;is, yield their results, respectively,
at the commencement, in the middle and at the end of the Dasha.
All the Grahas yield auspicious results in the Antar Dasha of
Naisargik (natural, constant) and Tatkalik (according to
position) friends. The results will be adverse in the Antar
Dasha of inimical Grahas.</p>

<h3>Antar Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is</h3>

<p>90-96. There are Antar Dashas of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is,
commencing from the R&#257;&#347;i, in which the Lord of the
Dasha is placed. There will be auspicious results, like
acquisition of kingdom in the Antar Dasha of a R&#257;&#347;i,
which is occupied by its own Lord, or a friendly Grah. There
will be inauspicious results, like loss of wealth, disputes,
danger from diseases etc. in the Antar Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;i, which may be Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or is
occupied by a malefic, debilitated Grah, or a Grah, placed in an
inimical R&#257;&#347;i. The R&#257;&#347;i, which contained
more auspicious marks in the Ashtak Varg will yield benefic
effects in its Antar Dasha. Adverse will be the effects of the
Antar Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, which contains more
inauspicious marks. For assessing the results the
R&#257;&#347;i, from which the Dasha commences, should be
treated, as Lagn and the Bhavas thereafter should be assumed to
have the characteristics, as if they are so from Lagn. Thus the
2<sup>nd</sup> Bhava from that R&#257;&#347;i will be the Bhava
of the wealth, the 3<sup>rd</sup> of co-borns and so on. There
will be gains, or losses of Dhatus etc., assigned to the
R&#257;&#347;is and the Grahas, in the Antar Dasha of the
R&#257;&#347;is concerned. In judging the effects of the Antar
Dashas of the Grahas their benefic and malefic nature, relations
with the malefic, or benefic, Drishtis on them and their
disposition in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya etc. should all be kept in
view.</p>

<p>97. The results of the Antar Dasha’s Pratyantar Dashas of the
R&#257;&#347;is should be assessed in the manner, explained in
this chapter.</p>

<h2><a name=51>Ch. 51. Working out of Antar Dashas of Grahas and
R&#257;&#347;is in Vimshottari etc. Dasha systems</a></h2>

<p>1. For finding out the span of the Antar Dasha of a Grah in
the Dasha of the same, or another Grah multiply the Dasha years
of the former with the Dasha years of the latter and divide the
product by the total Dasha years of all the Grahas. For finding
out the span of the Pratyantar Dasha of the same, or any other
Grah in the Antar Dasha of another Grah multiply the years etc.
of the Antar Dasha with the Dasha years of the other Grah and
divide the product by the total Dasha years of all the Grahas.
The figure so available in months etc. will represent the
Pratyantar Dasha of the former.</p>

<p>2. In every Dasha the first Antar Dasha belongs to the Lord
of the Dasha. Then the further Antar Dashas belong to the other
8 Grahas in the same order, as followed for the Dashas. The same
applies to Pratyantar Dasha.</p>

<h3>The Antar Dashas of Char Grahas in Char etc. Dasha</h3>

<p>3-4. The Antar Dashas of the Charadi Kendradi Dasha of the
Grahas are worked out by dividing the Dasha years by 9.  The
first Dasha will invariably be of the Lord of the Dasha.
Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas of Grahas, placed in
Kendras, Panapharas and Apoklimas, respectively, according to
their strength.</p>

<h3>Antar Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is</h3>

<p>5. The Antar Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is is worked out by
dividing the Dasha years by 12. Pratyantar Dashas of the Antar
Dashas are also calculated in the same manner.</p>

<p>6. The Antar Dashas will start from the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i,
or from the R&#257;&#347;i 7<sup>th</sup> therefrom, whichever
is stronger. The Antar Dashas are in the onwards order, if the
Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is odd and in the reverse order, if it is
even.</p>

<p>7-12. O Brahmin! Now I will acquaint you with the special
characteristics of the order of the Antar Dashas of the
R&#257;&#347;is. If the Dasha R&#257;&#347;i is a Movable one,
the Antar Dashas of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is are in the onwards,
or reverse order. If the Dasha Asraya R&#257;&#347;i is a Fixed
one, the Antar Dashas will start from it and thereafter there
will be an Antar Dasha of every sixth R&#257;&#347;i. If the
Dasha Ashraya R&#257;&#347;i is a Dual one, the first Antar
Dasha will belong to it. Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas
of R&#257;&#347;is in Kendr to it, R&#257;&#347;is in Kendr to
the 5<sup>th</sup> from it and R&#257;&#347;is in Kendr to the
9<sup>th</sup> from it. In the case of all kinds of
R&#257;&#347;is, namely Movable, Fixed, or Dual, the order will
be onwards, if the Dasha Asraya R&#257;&#347;i is an odd one and
in the reverse order, if it is an even one. The so called Dasha
Asraya R&#257;&#347;i is known, as Pak R&#257;&#347;i. In the
first order R&#257;&#347;i, which is Pak R&#257;&#347;i, is also
called Bhog R&#257;&#347;i. Later, if the Dasha Prad
R&#257;&#347;i is even, then the Bhog R&#257;&#347;i will be
that, which is at the same R&#257;&#347;i distance, as the Dasha
Asraya R&#257;&#347;i is from the Dasha Prad R&#257;&#347;i. For
the Char, Sthir and Trikon Dasha, the Pak and Bhog should be
determined in this manner. If Pak and Bhog R&#257;&#347;is are
associated with malefics, there will be pain in the body and
mental agony.  There will be enjoyment, if they are associated
with benefics. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha, like the Vimshottari
Dasha system, the span of Dasha should be multiplied by the span
of the Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i, whose Antar Dasha is
required and the product should be divided by the total Dasha
years of (all) the R&#257;&#347;i(s). The years, months etc. as
arrived at will represent the Antar Dasha of the R&#257;&#347;i
concerned.</p>

<p>13-16. Now I will tell you the method of working out the
Antar Dashas in the Pinda, A&#324;&#347; and Nisarg Dashas. The
Lord of Dasha is Dasha Pachak of full part, the Grah, associated
with, is Pachak of &frac12; part, the Grah in Trikon from him is
Pachak of l/3 part and the Grah in the 4<sup>th</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup> from him are Pachak of &frac14; part, the Grah in
the 7<sup>th</sup> from him is Pachak of l/7 part of the Dasha.
No Grah in any other Bhava is Antar Dash Pachak. In this manner
there are Antar Dasha Pachakas in the above-mentioned Bhavas
from the various Bhavas, including Lagn. In any of such Bhavas,
if there are more than one Grah, then the one, who is the
strongest amongst them will be the Pachak. Take the fractions
and reduce them in equivalent fractions with a common
denominator.  Add up the aliquot parts of the Dasha,
representative of the various numerators, leaving out the
denominators. The Antar Dashas will be arrived at, when the
various aliquots are converted into years, months etc. within
the main Dasha and divided by the above sum. (The calculations,
given above, are not the literal translation of the text in the
verses concerned, but their actual meaning and sense. This has
been got confirmed by checking up with similar information,
given in Kalyana Varma’s Saravali and Varamihir’s Brihat
Jatak)</p>

<h2><a name=52>Ch. 52. Effects of the Antar Dashas in the Dasha of
S&#363;rya (Vimshottari)</a></h2>

<p>1-3. Good effects, like acquisition of wealth and grains
etc., are derived in the Antar Dasha of S&#363;rya in his own
Dasha, if S&#363;rya is exalted, in his own Bhava, in Labh, in a
Kendr, or in a Trikon. Adverse results will be experienced, if
S&#363;rya is debilitated, or in an inauspicious Bhava, or
R&#257;&#347;i. Medium effects will be realized, if S&#363;rya
is in other houses. If S&#363;rya is the Lord of Dhan, or
Yuvati, there will be danger of premature death, or death-like
sufferings. The remedial measures to be adopted are Mrityunjaya
Japa, or the worship of S&#363;rya (by recitation of appropriate
Mantras, charity etc.).</p>

<p>4-6. Functions, like marriage etc., gain of wealth and
property, acquisition of a house, of land, cattle and
conveyances etc. will be the effects of the Antar Dasha of Candr
in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, if Candr is in a Kendr, or in a
Trikon. There will be marriage of the native, birth of children,
beneficence of and favours from kings and fulfillment of all
ambitions, if Candr is in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, or in
his own R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>7-10. Distress to wife and children, failures in ventures,
disputes with others, loss of servants, antagonism with the king
and destructions of wealth and grains will be the effects, if
Candr is waning, or is associated with malefics. Effects, like
danger from water, mental agony, imprisonment, danger from
diseases, loss of position, journeys to difficult places,
disputes with coparceners, bad food, trouble from thieves etc.,
displeasure of the king, urinary troubles, pains in the body
will be experienced, if Candr is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya.</p>

<p>11-12&frac12;. Luxuries, comforts, pleasures, dawn of fortune
(Bhagyodaya), increase in the enjoyment from wife and children,
acquisition of kingdom, performance of marriage and religious
functions, gain of garments, land and conveyance and birth of
children and grandchildren will be the auspicious effects, if
there are benefics in the 1<sup>st</sup>, the 9<sup>th</sup>, or
a Kendr from the Lord of the Dasha.</p>

<p>13-14. Unpalatable food, or course food, exile to outside
places etc. will be the effects in the Antar Dasha, if Candr is
in the 6<sup>th</sup>, the 8<sup>th</sup>, or the
12<sup>th</sup> from the Lord of the Dasha, or, if Candr is
weak. There will be premature death, if Candr is the Lord of a
Marak Bhava. To acquire peace and comfort, the remedial measure
is giving in charity of a white cow and a female buffalo
(Mahishi).</p>

<p>15-18. Auspicious effects, like acquisition of land, gain of
wealth and grains, acquisition of a house etc. will be derived
in the Antar Dasha of Mangal in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, if
Mangal is in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, in his own
R&#257;&#347;i, in a Kendr, or in a Trikon. All-round gains,
attainment of the position of a Commander of the Army,
destruction of enemies, peace of mind, family comforts and
increase in the number of co-borns will be the effects, if
Mangal is yuti with the Lagn’s Lord.</p>

<p>19-20. Brutality, mental ailment, imprisonment, loss of
kinsmen, disputes with brothers and failure in ventures will
result, if Mangal is in the 8<sup>th</sup>, or in the
12<sup>th</sup> from the Lord of the Dasha, if Mangal is
associated with malefics, or, if Mangal is without dignity and
strength.</p>

<p>21-22. Destruction of wealth by the displeasure of the king
will be the effect, if Mangal is in his debilitation
R&#257;&#347;i, or be weak. Diseases of the mind and body will
result, if Mangal is the Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati Bhava. Recovery
from ill health, increase in longevity and success in adventures
are possible, if remedial measure, like recitation of Vedas,
Japa and Vrashotsarg are performed in the prescribed manner.</p>

<p>23-26&frac12;. In the Antar Dasha of Rahu in the Dasha of
S&#363;rya, if Rahu is in a Kendr, or in a Trikon from Lagn,
there will be in the first two months loss of wealth, danger
from thieves, snakes, infliction of wounds and distress to wife
and children. After 2 months inauspicious effects will disappear
and enjoyment and comforts, sound health, satisfaction, favours
from the king and government etc. will be the favourable
effects, if Rahu is yuti with benefics, or, if Rahu is in the
Nav&#257;&#324;&#347; of a benefic. Recognition from the king,
good fortune, name and fame, some distress to wife and children,
birth of a son, happiness in the family etc. will be derived, if
Rahu is in an Upachaya from Lagn, if Rahu is associated with a
Yog Karak, or is placed auspiciously from the Lord of the
Dasha.</p>

<p>27-29. Imprisonment, loss of position, danger from thieves
and snakes, inflection of wounds, happiness to wife and
children, destruction of cattle, house and agricultural fields,
diseases, consumption (Gulma - enlargement of the skin),
dysentery etc. will be the results, if Rahu is weak, or is in
the 8<sup>th</sup>, or in the 12<sup>th</sup> from the Lord of
the Dasha.</p>

<p>30-31. Adverse effects, like premature death and danger from
snakes will be derived, if Rahu is in Dhan, or Yuvati, or, if
Rahu is associated with the Lords of either of these Bhavas.
Worship of Goddess Durga, Japa, giving in charity of a black
cow, or female buffalo are the remedial measures for alleviation
of the above evil effects, or total escape from them.</p>

<p>32-33&frac12;. Marriage of the native, favours by the king,
gain of wealth and grains, birth of a son, fulfillment of the
ambitions by the beneficence of the sovereign and gain of
clothes will be the auspicious effects, derived in the Antar
Dasha of Guru in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, if Guru is in a Kendr,
or in a Trikon to Lagn, in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, in his
own R&#257;&#347;i, or in his own Varg.</p>

<p>34-36. Acquisition of a kingdom, comforts of conveyance, like
palanquin (motor car in the present times), gain of position
etc. will result, if Guru is the Lord of Dharm, or Karm. Better
fortune, charities, religious inclinations, worship of deities,
devotion to preceptor, fulfillment of ambitions will be the
auspicious effects, if Guru is well placed with reference to the
Lord of the Dasha.</p>

<p>37-39. Distress to wife and children, pains in the body,
displeasure of the king, non-achievement of desired goals, loss
of wealth, due to sinful deeds, mental worries etc. will result
in his Antar Dasha, if Guru is in the 6<sup>th</sup>, or in the
8<sup>th</sup> from the Lord of the Dasha, or is associated with
malefics. Giving in charity gold, a tawny-coloured cow (Kapila
Gaya), worship of Isht Lord (Isht Dev) are the remedial measures
to obtain alleviation of the evil effects and to achieve good
health and happiness.</p>

<p>40-42. Destruction of foes, full enjoyment, some gain of
grains, auspicious functions, like marriage etc. at home will be
the good effects, derived in the Antar Dasha of &#346;ani in the
Dasha of S&#363;rya, if &#346;ani is in a Kendr, or in a Trikon
from Lagn. Well-being, acquisition of more property, recognition
by the king, achievement of renown in the country, gain of
wealth from many sources will be the effects, if &#346;ani is in
his exaltation, in his own, in a friendly R&#257;&#347;i and, if
&#346;ani is yuti with a friendly Grah.</p>

<p>43-44. Rheumatism, pains, fever, dysentery-like disease,
imprisonment, loss in ventures, loss of wealth, quarrels,
disputes with coparceners, claimants etc. will be the effects in
the Antar Dasha, if &#346;ani is in the 8<sup>th</sup>, or the
12<sup>th</sup> from the Lord of the Dasha, or is associated
with malefics.</p>

<p>45-47. There will be loss of friends at the commencement,
good effects during the middle part and distress at the end of
the Dasha. In addition to other evil effects there will be
separation from parents and wandering, if &#346;ani be in his
R&#257;&#347;i of debilitation.  If &#346;ani is the Lord of
Dhan, or Yuvati, there will be danger of premature death. Giving
in charity black cow, buffalo, goat and Mrityunjaya Japa, are
the remedial measures for obtaining relief from the evil effects
of the Antar Dasha. These measures help to achieve happiness and
gain of wealth and property.</p>

<p>48-49&frac12;. Acquisition of a kingdom, enthusiasm and
vivacity, happiness from wife and children, acquisition of
conveyance through the beneficence of the sovereign, gain of
clothes, ornaments, pilgrimage to holy places, acquisition of a
cow etc. will be the good effects in the Antar Dasha of Budh in
the Dasha of S&#363;rya, if Budh is in a Kendr, or in a Trikon
from Lagn.</p>

<p>50-51&frac12;. Budh becomes very beneficial, if he gets
associated with the Lord of Dharm. Reverence from and popularity
amongst people, performance of pious deeds and religious rites,
devotion to the preceptor and deities, increase in wealth and
grains and birth of a son, will be the auspicious effects, if
Budh is in Dharm, Putr, or Karm.</p>

<p>52-53&frac12;. Marriage, offering of oblations, charity,
performance of religious rites, name and fame, becoming famous
by assuming another name, good food, becoming happy, like Indra,

<p>56-58. Maharishi Parashar said to Maitreya.  O Brahmin! The
effects of Antar Dashas in the Kala Chakr, which have been
described above, are based on Savya Chakr. The effects of Antar
Dashas in the Dashas of the R&#257;&#347;is in the Apsavya Chakr
have to be assessed, after taking into account the benefic and
malefic natures of the Lords of the R&#257;&#347;is.  People
have to enjoy the good, or suffer the bad results, according to
their good, or bad actions in the previous births. Everybody
suffers, or enjoys accordingly. The peculiarity in this respect
is, that inauspicious results have been ascribed to malefics.
But, if during the Antar Dasha the Grah concerned is a friend of
the Lord of the Dasha, the results of the Antar Dasha will be
favourable. If the Grah concerned is a benefic, but an enemy of
the Lord of the Dasha, his Antar Dasha effects will not prove
favourable. This is how the Antar Dasha effects have to be
analyzed and conclusions arrived at.</p>

<h2><a name=65>Ch. 65. Effects of Dashas of R&#257;&#347;is in the

<p>32. There is no doubt, that observance of remedial measures
in the form of prescribed Maharishi Yagyas destroys the evil
effects of the inauspicious Dashas and yield happiness.</p>

<h2><a name=66>Ch. 66. AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-4. Maitreya said: “O Venerable Sage! You have described
many kinds of effects, relating to the Grahas and Bhavas, after
incorporating the views of many sages and Acharyas, but it is
not possible to say with certainty, if a particular effect is
quite correct, after considering the contradictions in the
effects by the movements of the various Grahas. As because of
sinful deeds, committed by people in Kaliyuga, their minds have
become blunt, be kind enough to describe a method, which would
enable even the shallow minded persons to ascertain their
happiness and sorrows and determine their longevity on the basis
of the positions of the Grahas in transit.”</p>

<p>5-6. The sage replied: “O Brahmin! You have put a very
intelligent question. I will now describe the Shastra for the
benefit of all, the Shastra, in which there will be no
contradictions in judging the effects of happiness and sorrows
and for determination of the longevity. You now listen to me
carefully.</p>

<p>7-11. If the 12 Bhavas, including Lagn, are occupied by, or
aspected by benefic Grahas, they yield auspicious results,
according to their characteristics, but this happens, where the
Grahas concerned are in their exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, own
R&#257;&#347;i, or posited in a benefic Bhava. There will be no
good effects, if such Grahas are in depression, or posited in an
inauspicious Bhava. Similarly the Bhavas, associated with, or
aspected by malefics in depression, or posited in malefic
Bhavas, yield adverse results, according to their
characteristics. If such Grahas be in their exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, the effects will not be adverse.  This is how
the general effects have been described by the Daivajnas. I have
only repeated those effects. The main purposes of this Jyotish
Shastra are to determine the longevity and joys and sorrows of
the people, but because the movements of the Grahas are so
subtle, even sages, like Vashista and Brihaspati, have not been
able to be quite definite in this respect. Then how can a common
man, particularly in Kaliyuga, do so.</p>

<p>12. There are two divisions, or parts of the Jyotish Shastra,
namely general and particular. I have already dealt with the
general part. I now come to the other part, which deals with
this subject in particular.</p>

<p>13-15. As the effects of the twelve Bhavas are judged from
Lagn and Candr, effects of the twelve Bhavas and the various
Grahas are judged in the same manner. Therefore the inauspicious
places from the seven Grahas, named, as Karan, beginning from
S&#363;rya and Lagn (total 8), should be marked by dots (Bindus)
and auspicious places, named, as Sthan, by small vertical lines
(Rekhas) and on the basis of their assessment should the
judgment of the horoscope and predictions be made.”</p>

<p>Notes. The above arrangement is known, as AshtakaVarg. The
meaning of AshtakaVarg is literally the group of eight things.
In other words it is the combination of the good and bad
positions of a Grah with reference to the seven Grahas and Lagn.
So it is the combination of the benefic and malefic marks (the
Rekhas and the Bindus) in a planet’s chart with reference to the
position of the eight Grahas (here Lagn is to be treated, as a
Grah).</p>

<p>16. Five Grahas in 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhavas
from S&#363;rya are Karanprad (dot significators). Similarly
four Grahas in the 7<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, three
Grahas in the 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>, six Grahas in
the 5<sup>th</sup>, 2 Grahas in the 10<sup>th</sup> and one Grah
in the 11<sup>th</sup> are dot significators.</p>

<p>17-19. Thus Lagn, Candr, Guru, &#346;ukr and Budh in the
1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> from
S&#363;rya; S&#363;rya, Mangal, &#346;ani, Candr and Guru in the
12<sup>th</sup>; Budh, Candr, &#346;ukr, Guru in the
4<sup>th</sup>; Lagn, Candr, &#346;ukr in the 9<sup>th</sup>;
S&#363;rya, &#346;ani and Mangal in the 6<sup>th</sup>; Lagn,
Budh, Guru and Candr in the 7<sup>th</sup>; &#346;ukr in the
11<sup>th</sup>; S&#363;rya, &#346;ani, &#346;ukr, Guru and
Mangal in the 3<sup>rd</sup>; Guru and &#346;ukr in the
10<sup>th</sup>; S&#363;rya, &#346;ani, Candr, Lagn Mangal and
&#346;ukr in the 5<sup>th</sup> are Karanprad, or dot
indicators.</p>

<p>20-22. In Candr’s AshtakaVarg 6 Grahas in the 9<sup>th</sup>
and the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5 Grahas in the 4<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup> and the 1<sup>st</sup>, one Grah in the
10<sup>th</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4 Grahas in the
5<sup>th</sup>, 3 Grahas in the 6<sup>th</sup> and the
7<sup>th</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup>, eight in the 12<sup>th</sup>
are Karanprad. Thus Lagn, S&#363;rya, Mangal, &#346;ani and
&#346;ukr, these five in the 1<sup>st</sup>; Lagn, Budh,
S&#363;rya, Candr, &#346;ani and &#346;ukr, these 6 in the
2<sup>nd</sup>; Guru in the 3<sup>rd</sup>; S&#363;rya,
&#346;ani, Candr, Lagn and Mangal, these 5 in the
4<sup>th</sup>; &#346;ukr, Budh, Guru, these 3 in the
6<sup>th</sup>; Mangal, Lagn and &#346;ani, these 3 in the
7<sup>th</sup>; Mangal, Lagn, &#346;ani, &#346;ukr and Candr,
these five in the 8<sup>th</sup>; Lagn, S&#363;rya, Mangal,
&#346;ani, Budh and Guru, these 6 in the 9<sup>th</sup>;
&#346;ani only in the 10<sup>th</sup>; none in the
11<sup>th</sup>; all the eight in the 12<sup>th</sup> from their
own places are Karanprad. These Grahas in the other Bhavas are
Rekhaprad (line significators).</p>

<p>23-27. In the AshtakaVarg of Mangal 6 Grahas in the
12<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>, 5 Grahas in
the 5<sup>th</sup>, 6 Grahas in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 7 Grahas in
the 9<sup>th</sup>, 5 Grahas in the 1<sup>st</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup>, 4 Grahas in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 3 Grahas in the
10<sup>th</sup> and 2 Grahas in the 6<sup>th</sup> are
Karanprad. In the 11<sup>th</sup> no Grah is Karanprad. In other
words all the Grahas in the 11<sup>th</sup> from their own
places are Rekhaprad. Thus S&#363;rya, Candr, Budh, Guru and
&#346;ukr, these five in the 1<sup>st</sup>; Lagn, S&#363;rya,
Candr, Budh, Guru and &#346;ani, these 6 in the 2<sup>nd</sup>;
&#346;ukr, Mangal, Guru and &#346;ani, these 4 in the
3<sup>rd</sup>; S&#363;rya, Candr, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr and
Lagn, these 6 in the 4<sup>th</sup>; Candr, Mangal, Guru,
&#346;ukr and Lagn, these 5 in the 5<sup>th</sup>; Mangal and
&#346;ani, these 2 in the 6<sup>th</sup>; Budh, Candr,
S&#363;rya, &#346;ukr, Guru and Lagn, these 6 in the
7<sup>th</sup>; Budh, Candr, S&#363;rya, Lagn and Guru, these
five in the 8<sup>th</sup>; S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh,
Guru, &#346;ukr and Lagn, these 7 in the 9<sup>th</sup>;
&#346;ukr, Candr and Budh, these 3 in the 10<sup>th</sup>; none
in the 11<sup>th</sup>; S&#363;rya, &#346;ani, Budh, Candr, Lagn
and Mangal, these 6 in the 12<sup>th</sup> from their own places
are Karanprad.</p>

12<sup>th</sup> from their own places are Rekhapradas.</p>

<p>69. In the charts of AshtakaVarg Karan is signified by a
Bindu, or dot (0) and Sthan by a Rekhapradas, or line (1). Karan
is inauspicious, while Sthan is auspicious.</p>

<p>70-72. To identify the auspicious and inauspicious Bhavas in
the AshtakaVarg a chart should be prepared with 14 horizontal
lines and ten vertical lines. The form of the chart so prepared
will consist of 117 apartments. In this chart in the first line
incorporates the names of the seven Grahas and Lagn. In the
first column write the numbers of all the 12 Bhavas. After this
mark dots under the Grah and against the Karanprad Bhavas. By
doing so the Karanprad Bhavas of all the 8 Grahas, including
Lagn, will become known clearly and whenever the AshtakaVarg
Grah will pass in transit the dot-marked Bhavas, he will yield
unfavourable results. In his transit to other Bhavas he would
give favourable effects.The following table shows the dots in
the AshtakaVarg of S&#363;rya.</p>

<h2><a name=67>Ch. 67. Trikon Shodhana in the AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! After preparing the
AshtakaVarg of all the Grahas, including Lagn, Trikon Shodhana
has to be done for each R&#257;&#347;i. A Trikon is made of
three R&#257;&#347;is equidistant from each other. Thus
<u>M</u>esh, Simh and Dhanu, <u>V</u>rishabh, Kanya and Makar,
<u>M</u>ithun, Tul and Kumbh, <u>K</u>ark, Vrischik and Meen
form the Trikonas of the R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>3-5. The Trikon Shodhana (rectification) should be done by
writing the Rekhas in the AshtakaVargas of S&#363;rya etc.
under the R&#257;&#347;is Mesh etc. Amongst the Trikon
R&#257;&#347;is the R&#257;&#347;i, which has lesser number of
Rekhas, should be allotted Rekhas, arrived at by deducting its
number of Rekhas from the greater number of Rekhas of the three
Trikon R&#257;&#347;is. No Trikon Shodhana is necessary, if any
of the Trikon R&#257;&#347;is has no Rekha. Shodhana should be
done, if all the three of them have equal number of Rekhas, that
is a zero should be written against all of them. Thereafter
Ekadhipatya Shodhana should be done in the same manner,
described later. (For Shodhana of the AshtakaVarg of a Grah the
first thing to be done is to see, in which R&#257;&#347;i the
Grah is posited.  Beginning from that R&#257;&#347;i, the names
of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is should be written and then the names
of the Grahas, posited in them, should be mentioned against
them. Thereafter the Rekhas, gained by that R&#257;&#347;i,
should be written below them and the number, achieved after
Shodhana, below it)</p>

<h2><a name=68>Ch. 68. Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-5. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is done after writing the numbers
for R&#257;&#347;is, arrived at by Trikon Shodhana.  Ekadhipatya
Shodhana is done, if both the two R&#257;&#347;is, owned by a
Grah, have gained a number after Trikon Shodhana. Ekadhipatya
Shodhana is not to be done, if one R&#257;&#347;i has got a
number and the other is bereft of any number. The following are
the rules for Ekadhipatya Shodhana. If both the R&#257;&#347;is
are without a Grah and the Trikon Shodhana numbers are
different, both should be given the smaller number. If both the
R&#257;&#347;is are with Grahas, no Shodhana is to be done. If
amongst the two R&#257;&#347;is one is with a Grah and a smaller
Trikon rectified number and the other is without Grah with a
bigger number, deduct the smaller number from the bigger number
and the number of the R&#257;&#347;i with Grah should be kept
unchanged.  If the R&#257;&#347;i with the Grah has a bigger
number than that of the R&#257;&#347;i without Grah, the
Shodhana should be done of the number of the R&#257;&#347;i
without Grah and the number of the R&#257;&#347;i with Grah
should be kept unchanged. If both the R&#257;&#347;is are
without Grahas and possess the same numbers, Shodhana of both
the numbers should be done and the rectified numbers should be
reduced to zero. If one R&#257;&#347;i is with Grah and the
other is without any Grah, the number of the latter should be
reduced to zero. S&#363;rya and Candr own one R&#257;&#347;i
only, their numbers should be kept unchanged.</p>

<p>6. After doing Ekadhipatya Shodhana, Pinda Sadhana should be
taken in hand.</p>

<h2><a name=69>Ch. 69. Pinda Sadhana in the AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-4. The Sage said. O Brahmin! After completing the Trikon
and Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVargas of all the Grahas,
the rectified number should be multiplied by the measure of the
R&#257;&#347;i. If there be any Grah in any R&#257;&#347;i, the
rectified number should be multiplied by the measure of the Grah
also. Then, after multiplying the rectified number of each
R&#257;&#347;i, the products should be added up. The total so
arrived at will be Pinda of that Grah. The multiples of
R&#257;&#347;is are 10 for Vrishabh and Simh, 8 for Mithun and
Vrischik, 7 for Mesh and Tul, 6 for Makar and Kanya. The
multipliers of the remaining R&#257;&#347;is are the same, as
their numbers. (R&#257;&#347;iman Chakr. Mesh 7, Vris 10, Mith
8, Kark 4, Simh 10, Kany 6, Tula 7, Vrsk 8, Dhan 9, <u>M</u>aka
5, Kumb 11, Mina 12) The multipliers of Grahas are 10 for Guru,
3 for Mangal, 7 for &#346;ukr, 6 for Budh, S&#363;rya, Candr and
&#346;ani.  (Grahman Chakr. <u>S&#363;rya</u> 5, <u>Candr</u> 5,
<u>Mangal</u> 8, <u>Budh</u> 5, Guru 10, &#346;ukr 7,
<u>&#346;ani</u> 5)</p>

<h2><a name=70>Ch. 70. Effects of the AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-6. The matters to be considered from S&#363;rya and other
Grahas are, as follows. S&#363;rya - the soul (Atma), nature,
physical strength, joys and sorrows and father. Candr - mind,
wisdom, joy and mother. Mangal - co-borns, strength, qualities
and land. Budh - business dealings, livelihood and friends. Guru
- nourishment of the body, learning, son (children), wealth and
property. &#346;ukr - marriage, enjoyments, conveyance,
prostitution and sexual intercourse with women.  &#346;ani -
longevity, source of maintenance, grief, danger, losses and
death.  The following procedure should be adopted to ascertain
the effects of a house.  Multiply the number of Rekhas with the
Yog Pinda (R&#257;&#347;i Pinda plus Grah Pinda), connected with
the AshtakaVarg of that Grah and divide the product by 27. The
remainder will denote the number of the Nakshatr. During the
transit of &#346;ani in that Nakshatr the Bhava concerned will
be harmed.</p>

<p>7-9. The 9<sup>th</sup> house from S&#363;rya at the time of
birth deals with father. The Rekhas of that R&#257;&#347;i, as
marked in S&#363;rya’s AshtakaVarg, should be multiplied by the
Yog Pinda and the product be divided by 27. The remainder will
denote the number of Nakshatr. The father will be in distress,
or he will otherwise suffer, when &#346;ani in transit passes
through the Nakshatr. Even, when &#346;ani passes in transit the
Trikon Nakshatras, father, or relatives, like father, may die,
or suffer.</p>

<p>Notes. By dividing the 27 Nakshatras in three equal parts,
the 1<sup>st</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> fall in
Trikon from each other. S&#363;rya is PitraKarak (significator
of father).  Therefore all about father is ascertained from the
S&#363;rya’s AshtakaVarg.</p>

<p>10-11. If the AshtakaVarg Rekha number is multiplied by the
Yog Pinda and the product is divided by 12, the remainder will
denote the R&#257;&#347;i, through which, or through the
R&#257;&#347;is in Trikon to it, the transit of &#346;ani will
cause harm, or unfavourable effects to father. Death of the
father may occur, if the Dasa prevailing at that time be
unfavourable. If the Dasa be favourable, father will face only
adverse effects.</p>

<p>(12-15 Arishta to Father) 12-14. The death of the father may
be expected, if Rahu, &#346;ani, or Mangal are in the
4<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya at the time of transit of
&#346;ani through any of the above three R&#257;&#347;is (Trikon
R&#257;&#347;is). The death of the father will come to pass by
such transit, if at that time &#346;ani, associated, or aspected
by a malefic, be in the 9<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, or Candr
and/or the Dasa of the Lord of the 4<sup>th</sup> from Lagn be
in operation. The death does not take place, if a favourable
Dasa be in force at the time of &#346;ani’s transit. This should
be kept in mind by the Jyotishis, while making predictions.</p>

<p>15. If the R&#257;&#347;i of Lagn of the native be the
8<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i from Lagn of the father, or, if
the Lord of the 8<sup>th</sup> from father’s Lagn be in Lagn of
the native, he takes over all the responsibilities of his father
after the latter’s death.</p>

<p>16-18. The father enjoys happiness in the Dasa of the Lord of
the 4<sup>th</sup> from Lagn. The native is obedient to his
father, if the Lord of the 4<sup>th</sup> be in Lagn, or the
11<sup>th</sup>, or in the 11<sup>th</sup>, or 10<sup>th</sup>
from Candr. If the birth be in the 3<sup>rd</sup> R&#257;&#347;i
from Lagn, or Candr of the father, the native makes proper use
of the wealth, inherited from his father. If the birth be in the
10<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i from Lagn, or Candr of the
father, the native will inherit all the good qualities of his
father. If the Lord of the 10<sup>th</sup> be in Lagn, the
native will be more distinguished than his father.</p>

<p>19-20. No auspicious functions, like marriage etc., should be
performed in the month of R&#257;&#347;is (that is, when
S&#363;rya transits that R&#257;&#347;i), which has more number
of dots in S&#363;rya’s AshtakaVarg. The same applies to the
Samvatsar of that R&#257;&#347;i (that is, when the mean Guru
transits that R&#257;&#347;i).  Auspicious functions should be
performed, when S&#363;rya, or the mean Guru transits the
R&#257;&#347;i, which has more Rekhas in S&#363;rya’s
AshtakaVarg.</p>

<p>21-23. In the same manner no auspicious functions should be
performed during the transit of Candr in the R&#257;&#347;i,
which has larger number of dots in Candr’s AshtakaVarg.
Consideration, regarding mother, house and village, should be
done from the 4<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Candr. Therefore
multiply the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg of Candr by the
Yog Pinda of that AshtakaVarg and divide the product by 27. The
death of, or distress to mother may be expected, when &#346;ani
passes in transit through the Nakshatr, denoted by the
remainder. Then divide the product by 12. The death of the
mother may occur, when &#346;ani transits the R&#257;&#347;i,
denoted by the remainder. Distress to mother may be predicted,
when &#346;ani transits the Nakshatras, or R&#257;&#347;is in
Trikon to Nakshatr and R&#257;&#347;i, indicated above.</p>

<p>24-27. Consideration of brothers (co-borns), valour and
patience is done from Mangal’s AshtakaVarg. If the number of
Rekha is larger in any R&#257;&#347;i after Trikon Shodhana,
there will be gains of land, happiness from wife and great
happiness to brother, when Mangal passes through that
R&#257;&#347;i in transit. If Mangal be weak, the brothers will
be short lived. There will be distress to brothers, when Mangal
transits a R&#257;&#347;i without Rekhas. Here also the Yog
Pinda of Mangal should be multiplied by the number of Rekhas in
the AshtakaVarg and the product be divided separately by 27 and
12. The remainders will denote the Nakshatr and R&#257;&#347;i.
The brother will suffer, whenever &#346;ani transits that
Nakshatr, or R&#257;&#347;i (or the Trikon Nakshatras, or
R&#257;&#347;is).</p>

<p>28-29. Consideration in regard to family, maternal uncle and
friends should be done from the 4<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Budh.
The family etc. will enjoy happiness during the transit of
Budh’s AshtakaVarg. After performing Trikon and Ekadhipatya
Shodhana in Budh’s AshtakaVarg, the happiness, or distress of
the family should be predicted from the transit of &#346;ani
through the resultant Nakshatr and R&#257;&#347;i (and those in
Trikon to them).</p>

<p>30-33. All about knowledge, religious inclinations of the
native and son (progeny) is to be ascertained from the
5<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Guru. If the Rekhas in the
5<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Guru are larger in number in the
AshtakaVarg, there will be great happiness in respect of
progeny. If the dots are larger in number, the happiness in
respect of progeny will be meagre. The number of children are
equal to the number of Rekhas in the 5<sup>th</sup> Bhava (from
Guru), provided it is not the R&#257;&#347;i of debilitation of
Guru, or his enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i. In that case the number of
children will be very limited. The number of children is also
equal to the number of Navams, in which the Lord of the
5<sup>th</sup> from Guru is posited.  Multiply the Yog Pinda of
Guru by the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg and divide the
product separately by 27 and 12. The remainders will denote the
Nakshatr and R&#257;&#347;i. Transit of &#346;ani through that
Nakshatr and its Trikon Nakshatras and of that R&#257;&#347;i
and its Trikon R&#257;&#347;is will be inauspitious. During that
period the knowledge, learning and religious activities of the
native will also be adversely affected.</p>

<p>34-36. There will be gain of wealth, land and happiness and
marriage, whenever &#346;ukr passes in transit through the
R&#257;&#347;is, which have larger number of Rekhas in the
AshtakaVarg of &#346;ukr. These gains will be from the
directions of the 7<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i from &#346;ukr
and of its Trikon R&#257;&#347;is. The effects should be judged
in the manner, already explained earlier, after multiplying the
Rekhas in the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava from &#346;ukr by the Yog
Pinda.</p>

<p>37-40. The 8<sup>th</sup> Bhava from &#346;ani signifies
death, as well as longevity. Assessment about longevity should
be made from that Bhava through the AshtakaVarg. Therefore
predict distress to the native in the year, equal to the number
of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg from Lagn up to &#346;ani. The
year, equal to the number of Rekhas from &#346;ani up to Lagn,
will also be of distress. If in the year, equal to the total of
the above Rekhas, Arishta Dasa be also in operation, there can
be possibility of death of the native.</p>

<p>41-42. Multiply the Yog Pinda by the number of Rekhas in the
AshtakaVarg and divide the product by 27. The death of the
native will take place, when &#346;ani passes in transit through
the Nakshatr, denoted by the remainder, or its Trikon
Nakshatras. Again, divide the product by 12. The native will
face danger of death, when &#346;ani passes in transit through
the R&#257;&#347;i, denoted by the remainder, or through its
Trikon R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>43-44. The results will be favourable, when &#346;ani passes
in transit through R&#257;&#347;is, which have larger number of
Rekhas in &#346;ani’s AshtakaVarg. &#346;ani’s transit through
R&#257;&#347;is, which have larger number of dots, will produce
only evil effects.</p>

<h2><a name=71>Ch. 71. Determination of Longevity through the
AshtakaVarg</a></h2>

<p>1-4. The sage said. I will now describe the method of
determining longevity from the AshtakaVarg. For this purpose the
AshtakaVargas of Lagn and all the Grahas have to be studied. The
Rekhas in all the R&#257;&#347;is have been allotted specific
spans of life. The R&#257;&#347;i, which has no Rekhas, has been
allotted 2 days, that with one Rekha gets l&frac12; days, one
day for R&#257;&#347;i with 2 Rekhas, half day for
R&#257;&#347;i with 3 Rekhas, 7&frac12; days for R&#257;&#347;i
with 4 Rekhas, 2 years for R&#257;&#347;i with 5 Rekhas, 4 years
for R&#257;&#347;i with 6 Rekhas, 6 years for R&#257;&#347;i
with 7 Rekhas and 8 years for R&#257;&#347;i with 8 Rekhas. In
this manner the spans of life should be worked from Rekhas in
all the AshtakaVargas. Half of the sum total of all will be the
longevity, based on AshtakaVarg.</p>

<h2><a name=72>Ch. 72. Aggregational AshtakaVargas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Write down a R&#257;&#347;i
Kundali with 12 Bhavas, including Lagn. Then insert the total of
the Rekhas in all the AshtakaVargas of the Grahas in the
R&#257;&#347;i concerned. The AshtakaVarg with such Rekhas is
called the Samuday AshtakaVarg, or the aggregational
AshtakaVarg. From this should be judged good and adverse effects
of the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali.</p>

<p>3-5. In the aggregational AshtakaVarg the R&#257;&#347;i,
which has more than 30 Rekhas, gives favourable effects, that,
having between 25 and 30 Rekhas, produces medium effects and
that R&#257;&#347;i, who has less than 25 Rekhas, yields adverse
effects. Auspicious functions, like marriage etc., should be
performed, when the Grah, on whose basis the time and date of
functions are performed, moves into the R&#257;&#347;i with
favourable effects. The R&#257;&#347;i, which is productive of
adverse effects should be avoided for these purposes. For
example, the strength of Candr (CandraBal) is generally
acceptable for all auspicious functions. Therefore auspicious
functions should be performed, or started, when Candr is in the
R&#257;&#347;i with maximum number of Rekhas. The Grah in the
R&#257;&#347;i with favourable number of Rekhas produces
auspicious effects and the Grah in the R&#257;&#347;i with
unfavourable number of Rekhas yields evil results.</p>

<p>6-6&frac12;. Amongst the 12 Bhavas more than 30 Rekhas
advance the effects of a Bhava, between 25 and 30 Rekhas produce
medium effects and the effects of the Bhava, which contains less
than 25 Rekhas, get damaged.</p>

<p>Notes. From the above rules it can be interpreted, that, if
there are less than 25 Rekhas in 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>
and 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava, their effects become favourable. The
effects will become adverse, if these Bhavas contain more than
25 Rekhas.</p>

<p>7-8. If in a R&#257;&#347;i Kundali there are larger number
of Rekhas in the 11<sup>th</sup> than those in 10<sup>th</sup>
and there are smaller number of Rekhas in the 12<sup>th</sup>
than those in the 11<sup>th</sup> and Lagn contains largest
number of Rekhas, the native will be wealthy and will enjoy all
kinds of comforts and luxury.</p>

<p>9-10. Divide the 12 Bhavas in 3 sections.  There will be
sufferings and distress in that part of the life, which is
represented by the section of the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali with
more malefics.  There will be happiness etc., in the part of the
life, represented by the section of the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali,
containing more benefics. There will be mixed results in that
area of life, when the relative section of the R&#257;&#347;i
Kundali has equal number of benefics and malefics. The Bhavas
from Lagn up to the 4<sup>th</sup> signify childhood, those from
5<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> youth and those from the
9<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> represent old age.</p>

<p>11-28. There will be danger of death in the month of the
R&#257;&#347;i (period of S&#363;rya’s transit in that
R&#257;&#347;i), which has 7, or less than 7 Rekhas in the
Samudaya AshtakaVarg. To ward off this evil effect 20 Tolas of
gold and 2 heaps of sesame seeds, resembling the shape of a
mountain, should be given in charity. … possibility of death …,
… 8. Tuladan of camphor is recommended to obtain relief from
this evil effect. … danger of snakes …, … 9. A chariot with 7
horses should be given in charity …. … danger from weapons …,
which contains 10 …. An armour together with Vajra should be
given in charity to ward off …. … danger of disgrace for no
cause …, … 11. An idol of the moon, made of 10 Tolas of gold,
should be given in charity …. … danger of death from drowning …,
… 12.  Land full of crops should be given in charity …. … danger
of death from wild and violent animals …, in which there are 13
…. A Shaligram Shila should be given in charity …. … danger of
death …, … 14. A Varah Murti, made of gold, should be given in
charity …. … danger of the wrath of the king …, … 15. An
elephant should be given in charity …. … danger of Arishta
(calamity, disaster, or misfortune) …, … 16. A Kalpa Vriksha,
made of gold, should be given in charity …. … danger from
diseases …, that has 17 …. A cow and jaggery should be given in
charity …. … danger of conflict …, … 18. A cow, jewels, land and
gold should be given in charity …. … possibility of banishment
from the homeland …, which has 19 …. Family deity should be
worshipped …. … loss of intelligence …, … 20. Goddess Saraswati
should be worshipped …. … distress from diseases …, that has 21
…. A heap of grains, shaped, like a mountain, should be given in
charity …. … distress to kinsmen …, … 22. Gold should be given
in charity ….  The native will be in distress …, … 23. An idol
of the sun, made of 7 Tolas of gold, should be given in charity
…. … death of the kinsmen …, … 24. 10 cows should be given in
charity …. … loss of wisdom …, … 25. Goddess Saraswati should be
worshipped …. … loss of wealth …, … 26. Gold should be given in

Gh&#299;, clothes and gold should be given in charity …. … gains

<p>29. There will be all-round increase in wealth, happiness in
respect of children and enjoyments in the Samvatsar, month and
Nakshatr of the R&#257;&#347;i, which has more than 30 Rekhas. …
increase in wealth, property, children and good reputation, if
the R&#257;&#347;i has more than 40 Rekhas.</p>

<p>30-31. The R&#257;&#347;i, which is auspicious in AshtakaVarg
Samudaya, is considered auspicious for all auspicious functions.
Consequently the auspiciousness of AshtakaVarg should be got
checked before performing any function, like marriage etc. If a
R&#257;&#347;i is not auspicious in AshtakaVarg, then its
auspiciousness should be checked from transit effects. It is not
necessary to check transit effects, if a R&#257;&#347;i is
auspicious in AshtakaVarg. Thus the auspiciousness of the
R&#257;&#347;i in the AshtakaVarg should be considered, as
paramount.</p>

<h2><a name=73>Ch. 73. Effects of the Rays of the Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to tell you
about the number of rays of the Grahas. When S&#363;rya etc.
are in their deep exaltation point, their rays are: S&#363;rya
10, Candr 9, Mangal 5, Budh 5, Guru 7, &#346;ukr 8 and &#346;ani
5. The rays are nil, when these Grahas are in deep debilitation,
the number of rays would be proportionate with the number of
R&#257;&#347;i. The following method is to be adopted for
ascertaining the proportionate number of rays. Deduct the
debilitation R&#257;&#347;i etc. of the Grah, whose rays are to
be ascertained, from his longitude. If the remainder is less
than 6 R&#257;&#347;is it should be multiplied by the number of
rays of that Grah, mentioned above and the product should be
divided by 6. The result will denote the number of rays of that
Grah. In case after deduction the remainder is more than 6
R&#257;&#347;is, then it should be deducted from 12. The other
procedure will remain the same.</p>

<p>3-7. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Other Acharyas have
recommended further correction of the number of rays, worked out
in the manner described above. The corrections have to be made,
as follows. If the Grah be in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, the
number of rays ascertained should be trebled. … Mooltrikon, …
doubled. … own R&#257;&#347;i, … multiplied by 3 and the product
be divided by 2. … R&#257;&#347;i of his Adhimitr (great
friend), … multiplied by 4 and the product be divided by 3. …
Bhava of a friend, … multiplied by 6 and the product be divided
by 5. The number of rays ascertained should be halved, if the
Grah be in the Bhava of his enemy. If he be in the Bhava of his
Adhi-Shatru (great enemy), the number of rays ascertained should
be multiplied by 2 and the product be divided by 5. No
correction is to be made, if the Grah is in the Bhava of a
neutral. The effects should be declared after computation of the
net number of rays of each Grah.</p>

<p>8-18. The effects, produced by the number of rays of Grahas,
are given below. Between 1 and 5 poor and unhappy, even if born
in an eminent family. Between 6 and 10 poor, carrier of loads
and without wife and children. 11 meagre wealth and few
children. 12 meagre wealth, idiot and wicked. 13 thief. 14
wealthy, protector and maintainer of several families, learned
and observer of the traditions of the family. 15 head of the
family, achieves proficiency in many kinds of learnings, good
qualities. This is what Lord Brahma has said. 16 most
distinguished in the family. 17 employer of many servants. 18
maintainer of large family. 19 possessor of name and fame. 20
blessed with a large family and kinsmen. 21 maintainer and
protector of 50 persons. 22 charitable and kind. 23 well
cultured and happy. Between 24 and 30 healthy, powerful,
favourite of the king, splendourous, possessor of a large
family. Between 31 and 40 minister and maintainer and protector
of 100 to 1000 persons. Between 40 and 50 king. 51 and above
powerful sovereign.</p>

<p>19. The effects should be predicted, according to the number
of rays of the Grahas at the time of birth, after taking into
account the status of the native.</p>

<p>20. For example, if the rays are more than 50 in number, one
born a Kshatriya king’s family will become a powerful sovereign,
one born in a Vaishya family will become a king (or high
dignitary), one born in Sudra family will become wealthy and one
born in a Brahmin family will become very learned and will
observe all religious norms.</p>

<p>21.The effects of the Grahas, moving from their debilitation
to exaltation, are full. The effects of the Grahas, moving from
their exaltation to debilitation, will be lesser than described
above.</p>

<p>22-23. Auspicious and inauspicious effects of all the Grahas
are according to the number of rays they possess. The prediction
will not be correct without the knowledge of the effects of the
rays. Therefore it is imperative, that in the judgment of
R&#257;&#347;i Kundalis and declaring results the effects of the
number of rays of the Grahas be taken into account.</p>

<h2><a name=74>Ch. 74. Effects of the Sudarshana Chakr</a></h2>

<p>1-3. Maharishi Parasara said to Maitreya. O Brahmin! Now I
will impart to you the knowledge of a great secrecy and superior
importance, which was communicated to me by Lord Brahma himself
for the benefit of the world. This is a Chakr by the name of
Sudarshana, through which Devajnas will be able to predict the
favourable and unfavourable results for every year, every month
and every day from the time of birth to the time of death of a
person. Listen to this very intently.</p>

<p>4. O Brahmin! Take a point and from it draw three circles.
Within the circles draw 12 lines, so as to provide 12 Bhavas
within each circle. This is how Sudarshana Chakr is drawn.</p>

<p>5-6. In the first circle (innermost) place the 12 Bhavas from
Lagn with Grahas, posited there. In the circle next to the
innermost circle place the 12 Bhavas from the R&#257;&#347;i of
Candr with the Grahas in them. In the third circle place the 12
Bhavas from the R&#257;&#347;i of S&#363;rya with Grahas in
them. Thus there will be 3 R&#257;&#347;is in each Bhava of the
Chakr.</p>

<p>7-9. The significant aspect of this Chakr is, that Lagn,
Candr and S&#363;rya represent the first Bhava. The
2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> etc. up to 12<sup>th</sup> from
Candr and S&#363;rya will deal with the same subject, as they
do, when reckoned from Lagn. Then the results should be
assessed, according to the Grahas in each Bhava. In this form of
R&#257;&#347;i Kundali S&#363;rya is considered auspicious in
the first Bhava and inauspicious, or malefic in other Bhavas.
The malefics do not produce evil effects, if they are in their
exaltation R&#257;&#347;i. In this manner predictions should be
made, after considering the benefic and malefic natures of the
Grahas, their disposition and aspects from and on them.</p>

<p>10. A Bhava gets advancement, if it is occupied, or aspected
by the Lord, or a benefic. The Bhava, which is occupied, or
aspected by a malefic, is harmed.</p>

<p>11-13. The effects of a Bhava will be in accordance with the
Grah occupying it, or in accordance with the Grah aspected, if
no Grah is in occupation of the Bhava. The effects of a Bhava,
occupied by a benefic, will be auspicious and the Bhava,
occupied by a malefic, will be inauspicious. Effects of the
aspects will be the same. If a Bhava is influenced both by
benefics and malefics, the results will depend on the majority
amongst the benefics and malefics. If the number of benefics is
larger than the number of malefics, the results will be
auspicious. If reverse is the case, inauspicious, or evil
effects may be expected. If there are equal number of malefics
and benefics, those with greater strength will influence the
results of that Bhava. Mixed results should be declared, if
there be no difference in the strength of malefics and benefics.
The same would apply to aspects.</p>

<p>14. The effects should be declared, according to its Lord, if
the Bhava is neither occupied, nor aspected by a Grah.</p>

<p>15-16. A natural benefic loses his benevolence, if he is in
more malefic Vargas. Similarly a natural malefic loses his
malevolence, if he is in more benefic Vargas (SaptaVarg). A
Grah’s own R&#257;&#347;i, his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i and
benefic Vargas are considered auspicious. And malefic and the
Vargas of an enemy and debilitated R&#257;&#347;i are considered
inauspicious.</p>

<p>17. The sage said, that the results should be declared only
after assessing the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of all
the Bhavas.</p>

<p>18. Maitreya asked. O Venerable sage!  Kindly enlighten me on
one point. If all the Bhavas are judged in accordance with the
Sudarshana Chakr, why many learned sages have advocated
declaration of effects from the Bhavas, reckoned from Lagn in
R&#257;&#347;i Kundali?</p>

<p>19-20. The sage replied. The results should be declared in
accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, only when S&#363;rya and
Candr being in separate R&#257;&#347;is different from the
R&#257;&#347;i of Lagn. If amongst Lagn, S&#363;rya and Candr,
all the three, or two of them are in the same R&#257;&#347;i,
the judgment of effects should be made from the R&#257;&#347;i
Kundali only.</p>

<p>(21-23) The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about
the effects, produced every year and every month by the twelve
Bhavas in their Dasas and Antardasas, according to Sudarshana
Chakr.  Under this system every one of the twelve Bhavas,
beginning from the 1<sup>st</sup>, is allotted a Dasa period of
one year. Thus every year in 12 years a Bhava becomes Lagn of
the year and the remaining become 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>
and so on. Every year every Bhava will have Antardasa of one
month. By following the method of Lagn of the year here also,
there will be a Lagn of the month. The first Antardasa will be
of the first Bhava and then will follow for 12 months the
Antardasas of the other Bhavas, every Bhava assuming the role of
Lagn by turn. Every Bhava gets Pratyantar Dasa of 2&frac12; days
and Vidasa of 12&frac12; Ghatikas. The same method is to be
adopted for judging the effects of Bhavas in Pratyantar Dasas
and Vidasas.</p>

<p>24-26. At the time of commencement of a Dasa, if there be
benefic in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>,
10<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup>, favourable effects will be experienced in the
concerned year, month etc. The Bhava, which is occupied by only
Rahu, or Ketu, becomes harmful. The same will be the fate of the
Bhava, which is occupied by a larger number of malefics. If
there be benefics in Bhavas other than the 12<sup>th</sup>, or
6<sup>th</sup>, the Bhava concerned will produce favourable
effects. In other words, if the benefics be in the
12<sup>th</sup>, or 6<sup>th</sup> from the Bhava concerned,
unfavourable effects will be derived in the related year, month
etc. If there be malefics in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>
and 11<sup>th</sup> from the Bhava, assuming the role of Lagn,
then these three Bhavas will produce auspicious results. The
effects can be ascertained for every year, month etc.  in this
manner. The total number of years in Vimsottari Dasa are 120
years.  After every 12 years the same method of determining the
Dasas, Antardasas etc.  has to be repeated for Lagn and other
Bhavas.</p>

<p>27-28. After ascertaining the effects of the years, months
etc. in accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, assessment of
effects for the years, months etc. should be made on the basis
of AshtakaVarg.  The benefic, or malefic effects will be full,
if the assessment from both produces the same results. If they
are different, the comparative strength of both should be taken
into account to declare the final results.</p>

<h2><a name=75>Ch. 75. Characteristic Features of Panchmahapurushas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will relate to you the
characteristic features of Panchmahapurushas. When Mangal, Budh,
Guru, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani, being in their own, or exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, be in Kendra to Lagn, they give rise to Ruchaka,
Bhadra, Hamsa, Malavya and Sasa Yogas. These Yogas are called
Panchmahapurusha Yogas and the persons, born in these Yogas, are
known Panchmahapurushas.</p>

<p>3-7. The Ruchaka native possesses a long face, he is very
enthusiastic, has spotless lustre, is powerful, has attractive
brows, black hair and is fond of all things. He loves to fight
wars, is of dark-red complexion, is victorious over enemies, is
discriminating, is protector of thieves and has cruel
temperament and slender thighs. He is a devotee of Brahmins, has
marks of Veena, Varg, Dhanus, Pasha and Vrasha R&#257;&#347;is
in his hands along with Chakr Rekha. He is well versed in occult
sciences. He is 100 Anguls in height, his waste has the
circumference, equal to the length of his face and is 1000
Karshas in weight. He, as ruler of Sahyachala and Vindhya

<h2><a name=76>Ch. 76. Effects of the Elements</a></h2>

<p>1. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about the
effects of the five elements: space, air, fire, water and
earth.</p>

<p>2. Space, air, fire, water and earth are ruled by Guru,
&#346;ani, Mangal, &#346;ukr and Budh. The effects are
experienced in proportion to the intensity of the various
elements.</p>

<p>3-4. The native will have temperament, according to the
greater strength of the Grah at the time of birth. Guru,
&#346;ani, Mangal, &#346;ukr and Budh will, respectively, give
spacial (etheral), airy (windy), fiery, watery and earthy
temperament. If all of them, or many of these Grahas have equal
strength, the temperament will be of a mixed character.</p>

<p>5. If S&#363;rya be endowed with strength, the native will
have fiery temperament. If Candr be strong, the native will have
watery temperament. All the Grahas in course of their Dasa endow
the native with bodily lustre, relating to their elements.</p>

<p>6. The characteristic features of the person with fiery
temperament are: distressed with hunger, restless, lean and thin
body, learned, consumes a large quantity of food, sharp,
fair-complexioned and proud.</p>

<p>7. … earthy: emits fragrance of camphor and lotus, is fond of
luxuries, comforts and enjoyments and is permanently happy,
forgiving and has a deep voice, like a lion.</p>

<p>8. … etheral: acquainted with semasiology, expert in
diplomacy, brilliant, learned, unmasked face and long
stature.</p>

<p>9. … watery: is lustrous, can sustain burdens, is
soft-spoken, king, has many friends and is learned.</p>

<p>10. … airy: charitable, full of anger, fair complexion, fond
of wandering, victorious over enemies, king and has lean
physique.</p>

<p>11. When the fire element is predominant in a person, his
face and body exhibit lustre, like gold and he has happy-looking
eyes. He achieves success in all his ventures, is victorious
over his enemies and gets gains of wealth.</p>

<p>12. … earth, the body of the person emits various kinds of
fragrances. His nails, hair and teeth are are clean. He gets
gains of happiness and wealth and is religious-minded.</p>

<p>13. … ether, the person is a clever conversationalist and
becomes happy by learning to songs etc.</p>

<p>14. … water, the person’s body is slender, he enjoys good
health and tasty food and is happy on that account.</p>

<p>15. … air, the body is filthy. The person becomes an idiot
and suffers from rheumatism, sorrows and agonies.</p>

<p>16. The sage said. O Brahmin! The effects of the elements,
which I have described above, will be realized in full, if the
Grahas concerned are endowed with adequate strength. If they are
weak, the effects will be reduced in proportion to their
weakness.</p>

<p>17. If the Grah concerned is in his debilitation
R&#257;&#347;i, or be placed in an inauspicious Bhava, the
elemental effects will be adverse, that is, opposite to the
effects, described above. If a Grah is without strength, his
elemental effects will be experienced only in imagination.</p>

<p>18. If a person’s time, date and place of birth is not known,
he should determine the Dasa of a Grah from the effects,
mentioned above and, if he is facing evil effects, he should
take appropriate remedial measures to appease the Grah
concerned.</p>

<h2><a name=77>Ch. 77. Effects of the Gunas</a></h2>

<p>1-4. The Great Sage Parasara said. O Brahmin! When the
Sattva-Guni Grahas are predominant, the person born is
Sattva-Guni and of good character. When Rajo-Guna (passion of
love and pleasure) is predominant, the person born is Rajo-Guna
and intelligent. When the Tamo-Guna (attribute of darkness) is
predominant, the person born is stupid. When at the time of
birth all the Grahas are of equal dominance, the person has a
mixture of all the attributes. The persons (creatures) so
born<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  are classified, as Uttama
(most excellent), Madhyama (of intermediate type), Adhama
(despisable) and Udaseena (indifferent, or neutral) in that
order. Thus there are four kinds of animate beings (Prani). I
will relate their attributes, which have been described by
Narada and other sages.</p>

<p>5. The natural attributes of persons, belonging to Uttam
class, are possession of control over organs of perception and
mind, simplicity, truthfulness, patience and satisfaction.</p>

<p>6. Valour, splendour, patience, cleverness, not retreating in
war and protecting the holy men are the natural attributes of
persons, belonging to Rajo-Guna.</p>

<p>7. Greed, falsehood, idiocy, laziness and doing service of
others are the inborn attributes of persons, who belong to Adham
class.</p>

<p>8. Engagement in agriculture and business, protection of
cattle and speaking both truth and lies are inborn attributes of
persons, belonging to Udaseena class.</p>

<p>9. O Maitreya! Classify the people, as Uttama, Madhyama,
Adhama and Udaseena after observation of the attributes,
described above. A person should be considered appropriate for a
job, according to his attributes.</p>

<p>10. If amongst Sattva, Rajas and Tamas any attribute is the
most dominant, it is considered the most predominant of all.
Otherwise all have equal effects.</p>

<p>11. The affectionate relationship between an employer and
employee and man and women will be invariable and stable, if
they possess the same attributes.</p>

<p>12. O Maitreya! Amongst the above four classes of persons, if
there is any kind of relationship of even Adhama with Udaseena,
of Udaseena with Madhyama and of Madhyama with Uttama, there
will be mutual affection and happiness.</p>

<p>13. If the bridegroom has better attributes than the bride
and the master has better attributes than the servant, there
will be mutual affection (regard for each other) and happiness.
If the bride, or the servant possesses better attributes, the
relationships will be full of bitterness.</p>

<p>14. The attributes of the native are dependent on his father
and mother, his time of birth and the persons, he gets
associated with. These are the root causes of Uttama etc.
qualities, possessed by him. The attributes, endowed by the time
of the birth and associations, are stronger than those, received
from the parents.</p>

<p>15. Consequently the person is embellished with the attribute
Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas, whichever is predominant at the time of
birth. The predictions should therefore be made after taking
into account the time of birth.</p>

<p>16. The Supreme Lord of the Universe, who is indestructible
and omnicient, is the Kal. He is the Creator, Protector and
Destroyer of all movable and immovable.</p>

<p>17. These three faculties of Lord Kal are called nature.
Divided by these faculties, the imperceptible Lord Kal is also
perceptible.</p>

<p>18. In accordance with the self-created qualities by the
Perceptible form of Lord Kal, there are four kinds of limbs,
namely Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama.</p>

<p>19. From the Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama parts are
created Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama types of
creatures.</p>

<p>20. The Uttama part of Lord Kal is the head, Madhyama part
both arms and chest, thighs form the Udaseena part and the feet
fall in the Adhama part.</p>

<p>21. This is how a differentiation is made between classes of
movables and immovables, according to attributes and the parts,
from which the creations are made.</p>

<p>22. The Chaturvidha (four sided) Lord Kal has thus created
this Chaturvidha universe in consonance with his own
attributes.</p>

<h2><a name=78>Ch. 78. Lost Horoscopy</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Maitreya said. O Sage! You have so far described the
auspicious and inauspicious effects to be enjoyed, or suffered
by a person on the basis of the time of birth, but can the
auspicious and inauspicious be ascertained, when the time of
birth is not known? Kindly tell me, if there is any way to solve
this problem.</p>

<p>3-4. The Sage said. Your question is a good one and is for
the benefit of the world at large. Considering your attachment,
I will tell you about this problem also. If any, or all amongst
the Samvatsar, Ayana, Ritu, month, Paksha, Tithi, Nakshatr,
Lagn, R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsas etc. of the birth are not known,
these can be ascertained from Prasna Lagn (Query chart).</p>

<p>5-6. The Samvatsar of the birth of the querist will be the
same, as that of the R&#257;&#347;i in the Dwadasams, in which
the Prasna Lagn falls (Guru will be in that R&#257;&#347;i at
birth).  Saumyayan (Uttarayan - the northern course of
S&#363;rya) will be in the first Hora of Lagn and Yamyayan
(Dakshinayan - the southern course of S&#363;rya) will be in its
second Hora. The Ritu (season) may be determined with reference
to the Lord of the Drekkan, in which Lagn falls. Shishir will be
indicated by the Drekkan of &#346;ani, Grishma by that of
S&#363;rya and Mangal, Vasanta by that of &#346;ukr, Varsha by
that of Candr, Sharad by that of Budh and Hemanta by that of
Guru.</p>

<p>7. If there be any contradiction in the Ayana and Ritu, the
Ritu may be determined from Budh in place of Mangal, from
&#346;ukr in place of Candr and from &#346;ani in place of
Guru.</p>

<p>8-9. After the Ritu becomes known take the first part of the
Drekkan, as its first month and latter part, as the next month
of the Ritu. Then from the expired Amsas of the Drekkan
determine proportionately the Tithi, or the Amsas of S&#363;rya.
The Istakal, indicated by the Amsas (degrees) of S&#363;rya,
will be the time of the birth of the querist. From the Istakal
so calculated have to be worked out the longitudes of the Grahas
and Bhavas (Grah Spast and Bhava Spast). Predictions should then
be made in accordance with the dispositions of the Bhavas and
Grahas.</p>

<p>10. Maitreya asked. O Sage! Guru returns to the same
R&#257;&#347;i after every 12 years. Then from which circle of
Guru should Samvatsar be determined.</p>

<p>11-12. The Sage said in reply. O Maitreya!  When there is any
doubt about the Samvatsar, take the approximate age of the
querist and add multiples of 12 to the difference between the
R&#257;&#347;i of the Guru at the time of query and his
R&#257;&#347;i at the time of birth. The figure so arrived at
should be taken, as the possible number of years and the
Samvatsar should be determined accordingly. If by adding 12
there may appear to be difference in age, the position of Guru
should be fixed, according to guessed approximate age, in the
Trikon R&#257;&#347;i, 5<sup>th</sup>, or 9<sup>th</sup> of the
Prasna Lagn, as may be found feasible. Then, taking that, as the
Samvatsar, the Ayana, Ritu etc. should be worked out accordingly
in the manner already explained.</p>

<p>13. Maitreya asked again. O Sage! How will the time of birth
be known after ascertaining the month and the Amsas etc. of
S&#363;rya. Please explain this for the benefit of the
people.</p>

<p>14-16.The Sage said. After ascertaining the R&#257;&#347;i,
Amsas etc. of S&#363;rya at the time of birth, the longitude of
S&#363;rya (S&#363;rya Spast) should be worked out for the next
day after the number of days, taken by S&#363;rya after entering
into the R&#257;&#347;i, which will be equal to the expired
Amsas of S&#363;rya. Then the difference between the longitudes
of this rising S&#363;rya and S&#363;rya at the time of birth
should be converted into Kalas and multiplied by 60. The product
should be divided by S&#363;rya Spast, converted into Kalas. The
Ghatikas etc. so becoming available will represent the Istakal
of the birth before and after sunrise. If the longitude of the
Ista S&#363;rya be more than that of the rising S&#363;rya, the
Istakal of the birth will be so much after the sunrise.  If the
longitude of the Ista S&#363;rya be less than that of the rising
S&#363;rya, the Istakal of the birth will be so much before the
sunrise.</p>

<h2><a name=79>Ch. 79. Ascetism Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will describe to you the
Yogas, leading to ascetism, under the influence of which the
persons give up their homes and become initiated in some holy
order.</p>

<p>2-3. The Yog for ascetism is formed, when four, or more
Grahas, possessed of strength, occupy a single Bhava. The person
born will become a Tapasvi, a Kapali, he will be wearing a red
robe, be one, who keeps a Danda (staff), Yati, he will be keeper
of a Chakr, or he will be a naked Sanyasin, according to the
Grah, which is the strongest of the group:  S&#363;rya, Candr,
Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr, or &#346;ani. If a number of
Grahas are endowed with strength, the holy order of the one,
strongest amongst them, is accepted.</p>

<p>Notes. There is a similar verse in Varahamihir’s Brihat
Jatak, which, translated into English reads, as under. “If at
birth, four, or more Grahas, possessed of strength, occupy a
single Bhava, the person born will become a Sakya, Jeevika,
Bhikshu, a Vriddha, or Guru, a Charak, a Nirgrantha, or Visava,
a Vanyasana, or Vanaprastha, according to which of the Grahas is
the strongest Grah of the group: Mangal, Budh, Guru, Candr,
&#346;ukr, &#346;ani, or S&#363;rya. If the strongest Grah be
conquered in planetary war by another Grah, or Grahas at the
time of birth, the person will relinquish that stage of ascetic
life and review to his previous condition of life.” A
Vanaprastha is a religious man, engaged in the practice of
rigorous and devout penance (i.e. he will be a Tapasvi); a Vivas
is a naked ascetic (that is dwelling in hills and forests). A
Bhikshu is an illustrious ascetic with a single staff for his
symbol, engaged ever and anon in the contemplation of truths of
the sacred scriptures. A Charak is a religious mendicant,
wandering over many countries. A Shakya is an ascetic of the
Buddhist clan. A Guru is a celebrated teacher, endowed with
royal splendour. A Jeevika is a garrulous and gluttonous
mendicant.</p>

<p>4. If strong Grahas, capable of leading to ascetism, be
obscure by S&#363;rya’s rays (that is they be combust), the
person born, in spite of having reverence for the holy order,
will not become initiated in that holy order.</p>

<p>Notes. Brihat Jatak adds in this connection, that, if the
Grahas referred to above be overcome in planetary war and be
aspected by other Grahas, the person concerned will seek
admission into the holy order without success.</p>

<p>5. If the other Grahas lose their strength (in spite of being
in their exaltation R&#257;&#347;is etc.), as a result of
combustion with S&#363;rya, the native will enter the holy
order, as signified by S&#363;rya, that is, he will become a
Tapasvi.</p>

<p>6. If the Lord of the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by Candr (Janm
R&#257;&#347;i), having no aspect of other Grahas on himself,
aspects &#346;ani, the native gets initiated into the holy order
of the Grah, who is stronger amongst the two.</p>

<p>7. If the Lord of the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by Candr, be
devoid of strength and is aspected only by &#346;ani, the native
becomes initiated into the holy order, signified by &#346;ani
(Nirgranthas, naked ascetics).</p>

<p>8. If Candr be in the decanate of &#346;ani, or in the Navams
of &#346;ani, or Mangal and be aspected by &#346;ani, the native
becomes an ascetic and enters the holy order, signified by
&#346;ani.</p>

<p>9. There is planetary war, if Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr
and &#346;ani are together (within one degree of each other),
&#346;ukr is the conquerer, whether he is in North, or South,
but amongst the other four only one, who is in the North, is the
conquerer and that in the South is considered defeated in the
planetary war.</p>

<p>10. If the Grah, who leads the native to ascetism, is
conquered in planetary war by another Grah, or Grahas at the
time of birth, the person will relinquish the holy order, in
which he becomes initiated.</p>

<p>11. Maitreya asked. O Venerable Sage! If there be many
Grahas, who are significators for ascetism, then, which holy
order the native will get initiated into?</p>

<p>12. Maharishi Parasara replied. O Brahmin!  If all the Grahas
be possessed of strength, the native enters into the holy orders
of all the Grahas.</p>

<p>13. The native gets initiated into the holy order of the
Grah, whose Dasa gets into operation at first. Then he
relinquishes this holy order of this Grah at the commencement of
the Dasa of the next Grah and accepts the holy order, signified
by him.</p>

<p>14. When Guru, Candr and Lagn are aspected by &#346;ani and
Guru occupies the 9<sup>th</sup>, the person, born in the
Rajayog, will become a holy illustrious founder of a system of
philosophy (holy order).</p>

<p>15. When &#346;ani occupies the 9<sup>th</sup> from Lagn and
is not aspected by any Grah, the person, possessed of Rajayog,
will take himself to the holy order, before becoming a Lord of
men. If there be no Rajayog the native becomes an ascetic
(religious wanderer).</p>

<h2><a name=80>Ch. 80. Female Horoscopy</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya asked. O Sage! You have described the effects of
many kinds. Now be kind enough to throw light on Str&#299; Jatak
(female horoscopy).</p>

<p>2. Maharishi Parasara replied. What a good question! Listen
to what I am going to tell you about the R&#257;&#347;i Kundalis
of females. All the effects, that have been described till now
in the case of male horoscopies, will apply to females also.
Matters, relating to her physical appearance, should be
determined from Lagn, those, relating to children, from the
5<sup>th</sup> Bhava, fortune for the husband from the
7<sup>th</sup> and death of the husband (widowhood) should be
deduced from the 8<sup>th</sup>.  Those effects, which are
impossible to ascribe to the female, should be declared to be
applicable to her husband.</p>

<p>Brihat Jatak. “Of the effects, that have been described till
now in the case of male horoscopes and those, that may be found
in female horoscopes, suitable to females, should be declared,
as applicable to them alone. The rest should be ascribed to
their husbands. The death of the husband is to be deduced
through the 8<sup>th</sup> place (from Lagn, or Candr, whichever
is stronger). Matters, relating to her appearance, beauty etc.,
should be determined from Lagn and the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied
by Candr. It is from the 7<sup>th</sup> place (from Lagn, or
Candr), that her welfare (happiness) and the nature of the
husband should be ascertained.”</p>

<p>Mantreswara’s Phaldeepika. “Whatever effects are declared for
men, they are entirely applicable to women too. The woman’s
prosperity and happiness have to be deduced from the
8<sup>th</sup> place (from Lagn, or Candr, whichever is
stronger). Children should be declared from the 9<sup>th</sup>
Bhava and matters, relating to her appearance, beauty etc.,
should be determined from Lagn. It is from the 7<sup>th</sup>
place, that her welfare (power of influencing her husband) and
the nature of the husband should be ascertained, while her
association and chastity should be predicted from an examination
of the 4<sup>th</sup> Bhava. Benefics in those Bhavas produce
good results, while malefics in the above Bhavas are productive
of evil, unless they happen to own the Bhavas, in which case the
effects will be good.”</p>

<p>Jatak Parijata. Whatever effects may accrue from the
horoscopes of females, applicable only to men, should be
ascribed to the husband. The good and evil, affecting their
person, should be calculated from Candr and Lagn, whichever of
them is stronger. It is from the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Lagn,
or Candr, that all, that is worthy, or unworthy in the husband
should be ascertained and the death of the husband is foretold
through the 8<sup>th</sup>.  All this should be well weighed by
the strength, or weakness of the Grahas, benefic and malefic.
Before an announcement is made, of Lagn and Candr find, which is
stronger. It is with reference to this, that the luck, beauty
and strength of the women should be announced. Children and
wealth in abundance should be declared through the
9<sup>th</sup> Bhava therefrom. Wedded happiness, or otherwise
should be gathered from the 8<sup>th</sup> and husband’s fortune
from the 7<sup>th</sup>. Some Jyotishis opine, that the
well-being, or the reverses of the husband can be determined
from the 9<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>5. If at the time of birth of a woman Lagn and Candr are in
even R&#257;&#347;is, the woman will be truly feminine in
character. She will possess excellent qualities, be of steadfast
character, beautiful and physically fit.</p>

<p>6. If Lagn and Candr are in odd R&#257;&#347;is, she will be
masculine in form and masculine in bearing and, if they be
associated with, or aspected by malefics, she will be devoid of
good qualities and be sinful.</p>

<p>7. If amongst Lagn and Candr one be in an even R&#257;&#347;i
and the other be in an odd one, the woman concerned should be
declared to partake the characteristics of both male and female.
The qualities of Lagn, or Candr will be more predominant,
according to their strength.</p>

<p>8. O Brahmin! The effects in respect of women would
particularly depend on the R&#257;&#347;i and Trimsams of Lagn,
or Candr, whichever is stronger.</p>

<p>9-16. When Lagn, or Candr is in a R&#257;&#347;i, belonging
to Mangal, the woman, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will have
illicit relations with a man before marriage. If she be born in
Trimsams of &#346;ukr, she will become unchaste after marriage;
if of Budh, she will be full of guile and adept in conjuration;
if the Trimsams be of Guru, she will be worthy and virtuous; she
will be menial, or slave, if birth be in a Trimsams of
&#346;ani. … in a R&#257;&#347;i, owned by Budh, the female,
born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will be full of guile, will be a
hard-worker; if the Trimsams be of &#346;ukr, will be possessed
of good qualities; if of Budh, will be of the nature of
hermaphrodite; if of Guru, will be chaste. In a R&#257;&#347;i,
owned by &#346;ukr, a female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will
be deprived; if the Trimsams be of &#346;ukr, will be well known
and possessed of excellent qualities; if of Budh, will be
skilled in all arts; she will be endowed with all good
qualities, if born in a Trimsams of Guru; she will remarry, if
born in a Trimsams of &#346;ani. When Lagn, or Candr happens to
be in a R&#257;&#347;i, owned by Candr and the Trimsams of birth
is owned by Mangal, the female born will be self-willed and
uncontrolled; she will be unchaste and of loose character, if
born in a Trimsams of &#346;ukr; will be skilled in arts and
handiwork, if of Budh; will be gifted with all excellent
qualities, if of Guru; will become a widow, if of &#346;ani. …,
owned by S&#363;rya and the Trimsams of birth be owned by
Mangal, the female born will be very talkative; she will be
virtuous, if born in a Trimsams of &#346;ukr; will bear
masculine features, if of Budh; will be chaste and virtuous, if
of Guru; will be unchaste, if of &#346;ani. When the rising
R&#257;&#347;i, or the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by Candr, is
owned by Guru, the female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal, will be
endowed with many good qualities; she will be Punschali, if born
in a Trimsams of &#346;ukr; will be well versed in many
sciences, if of Budh; will be endowed with all good qualities,
if of Guru; will not indulge much in sexual intercourse, if of
&#346;ani. When Lagn, or the R&#257;&#347;i, occupied by Candr,
belongs to &#346;ani, the female, born in a Trimsams of Mangal,
will be a maid-servant; she will be learned (barren, according
to Brihat Jatak), if born in a Trimsams of &#346;ukr; will be
cruel and immoral, if of Budh; will be devoted to her husband,
if of Guru; will be unchaste (addicted to men of low caste,
according to Brihat Jatak), if of &#346;ani.</p>

<p>17-21. If the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava be without a Grah (without
strength) and without benefic aspect, the female born will have
a coward and contemptible wretch for her husband. When the
7<sup>th</sup> Bhava is a moveable R&#257;&#347;i, the husband
will always be away from home.  If Budh and &#346;ani be in the
7<sup>th</sup> Bhava, the husband of the woman concerned will be
impotent. If S&#363;rya occupies the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava, the
woman concerned is abandoned by her husband. If Mangal be in the
7<sup>th</sup>, the female concerned becomes a widow in her
childhood. If &#346;ani be in the 7<sup>th</sup>, she lives to
an old age, remaining unmarried. If there be a malefic, she
becomes a widow, while young. If there be a benefic in the
7<sup>th</sup>, the female born will enjoy marital happiness and
will be chaste. If there be both benefics and malefics in the
7<sup>th</sup>, both benefic and evil effects will be
experienced. If Mangal be in the Navams of &#346;ukr and
&#346;ukr be in the Navams of Mangal, the female concerned will
have illicit relations with other men. If in this Yog Candr be
in the 7<sup>th</sup>, the female concerned enters into illicit
connections at the instance of her husband.</p>

<p>22-25. If at woman’s birth the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava, or the
setting Navams be that of Mangal, the husband will be fond of
other women and will be of an irascible temper. If it be a
R&#257;&#347;i, or Navams of Budh, her husband will be very
learned and clever. If it be a R&#257;&#347;i, or Navams of
Guru, the husband of the woman concerned will be of great merit
and will have passions under his control. If it be a
R&#257;&#347;i, or Navams of &#346;ukr, her husband will be
fortunate, very good-looking and liked by women. If the
R&#257;&#347;i, or Navams belongs to &#346;ani, her husband will
be an old man and a fool. If the R&#257;&#347;i, or Navams be
Simh, her husband will be exceedingly soft in his disposition
and will be very hard-working. If the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava, or
the setting Navams be a R&#257;&#347;i, owned by Candr, the
husband of the woman will be love-sick and gentle. If there be
different R&#257;&#347;is and Navamsas in the 7<sup>th</sup>,
the effects will be of a mixed nature. The effects of the
R&#257;&#347;is and Navamsas will depend on their strength.</p>

<p>26-29. If in a female’s horoscope S&#363;rya be in the
8<sup>th</sup>, the native will be unhappy, poverty-stricken, of
deformed limbs and without faith in religion. If Candr be in the
8<sup>th</sup>, the woman concerned will be of a defective
vagina, will have ugly breasts, with sinister eyes, without
robes, or ornaments, sickly and will be defamed in the society.
If Mangal, the native will be of weak constitution, sickly,
widow, ugly-looking and full of sorrows and agonies. If Budh,
she will be without faith in religion, timid, devoid of wealth,
self-respect and good qualities and she will be quarrelsome.</p>

<p>30-33. If in a female’s horoscope Guru be in the
8<sup>th</sup>, the woman concerned will be shameless and
without virtue, will have few children, fatty hands and feet,
will be abandoned by her husband and be gluttonous. If &#346;ukr
be in the 8<sup>th</sup>, she will be fond of pleasures, devoid
of sympathy, religion, wealth, will be dirty and deceptive.  If
&#346;ani, the woman concerned will be of wicked disposition,
dirty, deceptive and devoid of conjugal harmony. If Rahu, she
will be ugly, without marital happiness, cruel-hearted, sickly
and unchaste.</p>

<p>34. The woman will be barren, if in her R&#257;&#347;i
Kundali Candr and &#346;ukr be associated with &#346;ani, or
Mangal and the 5<sup>th</sup> Bhava be occupied, or aspected by
a malefic.</p>

<p>35. If the 7<sup>th</sup> be in the Navams of Mangal, the
vagina will be diseased. If the 7<sup>th</sup> be the Navams of
a benefic, she will have a well formed female organ and will be
beloved by her husband.</p>

<p>36. If Mithun, or Kanya Lagn in a female’s horoscope is
occupied by &#346;ukr and Candr, the woman concerned lives
happily and is equipped with all kinds of comforts in her
father’s house.</p>

<p>37. If Candr, Budh and &#346;ukr be in Lagn, the woman
concerned is endowed with many good qualities and happiness. If
Guru be in Lagn, she is happy, wealthy and has children.</p>

<p>38. If the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhava be Simh, or Kark and
S&#363;rya and Candr be both placed there, the woman concerned
will be barren. If the 8<sup>th</sup> be Mithun, Kanya, or Kark
and Budh and Candr be posited there, the female native will have
only one child.</p>

<p>39. The woman concerned will be definitely barren, if Lagn be
Mesh, Vrischik, Makar, or Kumbh and Candr and &#346;ukr be
posited there, aspected by malefics.</p>

<p>40. The woman concerned will give birth to an already dead
child, if the 7<sup>th</sup> be occupied by Rahu and S&#363;rya,
or Guru and Rahu be in the 8<sup>th</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup>
be occupied by malefics.</p>

<p>41. The woman concerned will not be able to conceive, if Guru
and &#346;ukr be associated with Mangal in the 8<sup>th</sup>,
or Mangal be with &#346;ani in the 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>42. The woman concerned becomes a destructor of her husband’s
family and her father’s family, if at her birth Candr and Lagn
be subjected to Papa Kartari Yog (direct malefics in
12<sup>th</sup> and retrograde malefics in 2<sup>nd</sup>).</p>

<p>43. The woman, whose birth takes place under the following
conditions, is named, as Visha Kanya. Day of birth Sunday,
Nakshatr Aslesha, 2<sup>nd</sup> Tithi; Saturday, Krittika,
7<sup>th</sup> Tithi; Tuesday, Satabhisha, 12<sup>th</sup>
Tithi.</p>

<p>44. The woman will be Visha Kanya, if at birth Lagn be
occupied by a malefic and a benefic and two Grahas be in
inimical R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>45. Visha Kanya gives birth to a child already dead. She has
a defective generative organ and is bereft of robes, ornaments
etc.</p>

<p>46. The evil effects of Visha Kanya are destroyed, if the
Lord of the 7<sup>th</sup> is a benefic, or a benefic Grah be in
the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, or Candr.</p>

<p>47. The woman born becomes a widow, if Mangal be in the
12<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, or
8<sup>th</sup> from Lagn, without aspect by, or association with
any benefic.</p>

<p>48-49. The Yog, which causes the woman to become widow also
causes a male native to become a widower. If the man and woman,
possessing this Yog, join in wedlock, the Yog ceases to have any
effect.</p>

<p>50-51. If at a woman’s birth the rising R&#257;&#347;i be
that of &#346;ukr and the rising Navams be of &#346;ani (Kumbh,
according to Brihat Jatak) and, if &#346;ukr and &#346;ani
aspect each other, or are occupying each other’s Navams, she
will be afflicted with too much lust and will allay her fire of
passion with the help of other females, acting the part of a
male.</p>

<p>52. When Guru, Mangal, Budh and &#346;ukr are strong and,
when the rising R&#257;&#347;i is an even one, the woman born
will be learned in Shastras and an expounder of the Vedanta
Philosophy.</p>

<p>53. When a malefic Grah is in the 7<sup>th</sup> and some
Grah in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the woman concerned will become an
ascetic.</p>

<p>54. The woman dies before her husband, when in her nativity
there is a benefic in the 8<sup>th</sup>, without aspect by, or
association with a malefic.</p>

<p>55. If at the birth of a woman there are equal number of
benefics and malefics and they possess the same strength, she
without doubt will leave for her heavenly abode along with her
husband.</p>

<h2><a name=81>Ch. 81. Effects of Characteristic Features of Parts of
Woman’s body.</a></h2>

<p>1-2. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! I have been fully
enlightened by the auspicious and inauspicious effects,
described by you with reference to the Janm Lagn in a female’s
horoscope. Now I request you to favour me with knowledge of
auspicious and inauspicious effects with reference to the
characteristic features of the various parts of a woman’s body.
Maharishi Parasara replied. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you what
Lord Shiva narrated to Goddess Parvati in this regard.</p>

<p>3-4. A woman, whose soles are even, smooth, soft, well
developed, warm and shining in pink colour, without much
perspiration, will be enjoying full happiness, befitting her
sex. The one, whose soles are without pink colour, hard, dry,
coarse, uneven, shaped, like a winnowing basket and bereft of
flesh, will suffer misery.</p>

<p>5-6. The woman, who has marks of conch, Swastika, Chakr,
lotus, flag, fish, umbrella and a long line, rising upwards in
her soles, becomes a queen and enjoys great happiness and
comforts. The one, who possesses marks, like those of snake, rat
and crow, is bereft of wealth and suffers misery.</p>

<p>7. The girl, whose nails of toes are shining in pink colour,
smooth, raised and round, enjoys great happiness and comforts.
Blackish and torn nails denotes misery.</p>

<p>8. Raised, full, well developed, smooth and round great toe
indicates happiness. The one, which is small, irregular in shape
and flat, denotes misery.</p>

<p>9. The woman’s toes, which are soft, thick, round and well
developed are considered auspicious. If the toes are long, she
will be of loose morals. Thin toes indicate poverty.</p>

<p>10-16. Other effects about the toes are, as under. Short -
short life. Short and long and irregular in shape - procurer and
guileful. Flat - maid-servant. Spaced more than average - bereft
of wealth.  Toes, overlapping one over the other - widow and
dependent on others. If dust is thrown up, when she walks -
unchaste and brings defame to all the three families (her
father’s, mother’s and husband’s). If the smallest toe does not
touch the ground - she will destroy her husband and marry
another; If the middle toe and the one next to it does not touch
the ground - widow. First toe (next to great toe) longer than
the great toe - she will develop illicit connection with a man
before marriage and will be of loose morals.</p>

<p>17. If the back of the feet of a woman is raised, without
perspiration, soft and smooth, she will become a queen. If the
indications are contrary, she will be poverty-stricken. She will
be fond of travelling, if the back part of the feet be veined.
Hair on that portion of feet denote, that she will be a maid
servant. If the feet be bony, or without flesh, she will have a
defective sexual organ.</p>

<p>18. If the heels are even, the woman concerned will have a
well formed and desirable sexual organ. If the heels be stout,
she will have a defective sexual organ. If the heels be high,
she will be unchaste. Long heels indicate misery.</p>

<p>19. Legs (portion below knees). Even, smooth, evenly shaped,
round, without hair, good looking and without veins showing up
are R&#257;&#347;is, that the woman will be a queen.</p>

<p>20. Round, smooth, firm knees are auspicious indications. If
the knees be bony, the woman concerned will be of loose moral
character. If the knees be loose, she will be
poverty-stricken.</p>

<p>21. If the thighs are round, like the trunk of an elephant,
close to each other, soft and without hair, the woman concerned
will be a queen. If the thighs are flat and hairy, she will be
poverty-stricken and a widow.</p>

<p>22-23. Waist. Circumference equal to the width of 24 fingers
with well developed hips indicate, that the woman will be
fortunate. A waist, which is flat, long, without flesh, caved
in, or hairy, forebodes widowhood and misery.</p>

<p>24. Raised, fleshy and widespread hips in a woman are
auspicious in effects. If they are contrary, they indicate
inauspiciousness.</p>

<p>25-27. Sexual organ. Hidden clitoris, pink-coloured, curved,
like the back of a tortoise, soft, hairy, shaped, like the leaf
of a Pipal tree and smooth is highly auspicious. If shaped, like
the feet of a deer, or opening of an oven with hard hair and
with raised clitoris, it indicates evil. If the left side of the
sexual organ of a woman is raised, she will beget more female
children and, if the right side is raised, more boys. If the
organ is shaped, like a conch, she will be barren.</p>

<p>28. Portion below the navel. A soft, spread out and slightly
raised Vasti is auspicious. Hairy, veins, showing up and full of
lines (folds, or wrinkles) indicates inauspiciousness.</p>

<p>29. A navel deep with right turns is productive of good
effects. The navel raised, with left turns and with knots is
inauspicious.</p>

<p>30-31. A stomach well spread indicates a well formed sexual
organ and many sons. If the stomach of a woman resembles that of
a frog, her son will become a king. If a woman has a raised
stomach she will be childless. If the stomach is wrinkled, she
will become an ascetic. If it has circular folds, she will
become a maid-servant.</p>

<p>32. If the portion, covering the ribs, is even, well
developed and soft, auspicious effects may be expected. It will
be inauspicious, if it is raised, hairy and full of veins.</p>

<p>33. The chest of a woman, which is even and hairless is
auspicious. Wide spread and hairy chest is inauspicious.</p>

<p>34-36. The breasts of a woman signify good luck, if they are
of equal size, fleshy, round and firm, but close together.  They
are unlucky, if they are thick in front, are not close together
and without flesh. Raised right breast indicates, that she will
have sons. Raised left breast indicates, that she will have
daughters. If the portion, surrounding the nipples, is round,
good-looking and blackish, she will enjoy good luck. Pressed in
and unusually small breasts indicate bad luck.</p>

<p>37. Shoulders. Even, well built up and without joints showing
up are R&#257;&#347;is of good luck. Raised, hairy and without
flesh are unlucky.</p>

<p>38. The armpits, if soft, with thin hair, well developed and
smooth are auspicious. Those, which are deep, without flesh,
perspiring and with veins, showing up are inauspicious.</p>

<p>39-40. Arms, in which the bones do not show up and which are
soft jointed, hairless without obvious veins, straight and round
are auspicious. Those without flesh, hairy, small, with obvious
veins and irregular in shape are inauspicious.</p>

<p>41. If the thumbs of the woman are shaped, like a lotus bud,
they are auspicious. If they are without flesh and irregular in
shape, they are inauspicious.</p>

<p>42-43. If the palms of the woman are pink-coloured, raised in
the middle, with fingers close together (with no holes between
them), soft and have very few lines, she enjoys happiness and
all comforts. If the palms are full of lines, she will become a
widow. If there are no lines, she will be poverty-stricken. If
the veins show up in the palms, she will live on alms.</p>

<p>44. If the backs of the hands of a woman are well built, soft
and hairless, she will enjoy auspicious effects. It will be
otherwise, if the backs of the hands are with veins, showing up,
deep and hairy.</p>

<p>45-47. Lines on the palm. A woman enjoys happiness and all
comforts, if there is a clearly marked, pink-coloured, circular,
smooth, full and deep line (perhaps line of life is meant). If
there is mark of a fish, she will be very lucky. She will be
wealthy with mark of Swastika. She will be a queen with mark of
a lotus. She will be the mother of a king, if she has marks of
conch, umbrella and tortoise.</p>

<p>48-50. The woman, who has lines, forming the shapes of a
balance, elephant, bull, or horse, becomes the wife of a
businessman. The woman, who has lines, forming the shape of a
house, or Vajra is lucky and gives birth to a son, who becomes
learned in Shastras. The woman, who has lines, forming the
shapes of a chariot, a plough, or a yoke, becomes the wife of a
farmer. She will become a queen, if she has lines, forming the
shape of Chamar, Ankush, trident, sword, mace, Shakti, or
trumpet.</p>

<p>51-52. If in the palm of a woman there is a line, which,
starting from the root of the thumb goes up to the root of the
little finger, she becomes a widow. If there are lines, forming
the shape of a crow, a frog, a jackal, a wolf, a scorpion, a
snake, a donkey, a camel and a cat, the woman concerned suffers
misery.</p>

<p>53-54. If the fingers of a woman are tender with good-looking
phalanges, tapering at the end and without hair, they are
considered auspicious. If they are very small, without flesh,
irregular, widely spaced, with hair and with more than usual
phalanges, or without phalanges, they indicate misery.</p>

<p>55. If the nails of the fingers are pink-coloured, raised and
shaped well at the top, they are auspicious.  Depressed,
dirty-looking, or yellow, or white-coloured nails, or nails with
spots are inauspicious.</p>

<p>56. If the back of the woman is fleshy and well developed
with flesh, it is auspicious. The back with hair, irregular in
built and with veins showing up is inauspicious.</p>

<p>57-58. The neck of a woman with three lines (folds), with
bones not obvious, round, well developed and tender is
auspicious. A thick necked woman becomes a widow. An irregularly
built neck indicates, that the woman concerned will become a
maid-servant. Flat necked woman will be barren. A woman with a
small neck is childless.</p>

<p>59. A straight, well developed, somewhat raised throat is
auspicious. One without flesh, with veins obvious, with hair and
irregular in built is inauspicious.</p>

<p>60. Pink-coloured, tender and firm chin is auspicious. A
broad chin with hair and clefts is unlucky.</p>

<p>61. Raised, firm and round cheeks are auspitious. The ones,
which are hard-skinned, depressed and without flesh are
indicative of misfortune.</p>

<p>62. If the mouth of a woman is of normal size, firm, round,
emitting fragrance, smooth and good-looking, it is indicative of
good luck. If otherwise, it will be inauspicious.</p>

<p>63-65. If the lower lip of a woman is red, like a lotus,
smooth, divided in the middle and good looking, she becomes a
queen. If it be without flesh, coarse, long, dry and blackish,
it is indicative of misery and widowhood. If the upper lip of a
woman is pink-coloured, smooth and slightly raised in the
middle, it is indicative of happiness and good fortune.  If
otherwise, it will be inauspicious.</p>

<p>66-67. A woman, whose teeth are smooth, milk white, 32 in
number and whose upper and lower teeth, though equal in size,
are slightly raised, will be lucky. If lower teeth are more in
number, are yellow, or black-coloured, fierce looking, widely
spaced and double, they are indicative of misfortune.</p>

<p>68-69. If the tongue of a woman is red and soft, she enjoys
great happiness and comforts. Caved in the middle and spread out
in front indicates misery. White tongue indicates death in
water. Dark tongue indicates quarrelsome nature. Thick tongue
denotes poverty. Long tongue denotes one, who is omnivorous.
Long and broad tongue denotes lunacy.</p>

<p>70-71. Palate red, like lotus, soft and smooth - good luck,
white - widowhood, yellow - ascetism, black - barrenness, dry -
large family.</p>

<p>72. When a woman laughs, if her cheeks are raised and teeth
are not visible, she will be lucky. If it is otherwise, she will
not be lucky.</p>

<p>73-74. If the nose of a woman is evenly round and has small
nostrils, it is auspicious. If the nose is thick in its front
part and flat in the middle, it is inauspicious. If the tip of
the nose is red, or shrunken, widowhood is indicated. Flat nose
indicates engagement in a menial job. Too small, or too large
nose denotes quarrelsome nature.</p>

<p>75-77. Black pupils with cow’s milk like white portion of the
eye, large and broad, smooth, with black eyelashes are lucky
R&#257;&#347;is. Raised eyes show short life. Round eyes denote
loose moral character. Honey-coloured eyes indicate good fortune
and happiness. The eyes, like those of a pigeon, indicate
wickedness. Eyes, like those of an elephant, indicate misery. If
the left eye is blind, adulterous tendency will manifest.
Blindness of the right eye indicates barrenness.</p>

<p>78. A woman with soft, black, compact eyelashes with thin
hair is fortunate. Eyelashes thick, scattered and with
tawny-coloured hair indicate misery.</p>

<p>79. If the eyebrows of a woman are round, shaped, like a bow,
smooth, black, not joined and with soft hair, she is blessed
with happiness and fame.</p>

<p>80. Ears of a woman long with a round turn indicate children
and happiness. Small, unevenly shaped, very thin, with veins,
showing up, cause her misery.</p>

<p>81-82. The forehead of a woman without veins, showing
through, without hair, shaped, like a half-moon, even, with
equal to three fingers are R&#257;&#347;is of a fortunate woman,
blessed with husband and children. R&#257;&#347;i of Swastika on
the forehead denotes a queen. Very long, highly raised and hairy
forehead causes misery.</p>

<p>83. Head of a woman high and round, like that of an elephant,
is indicative of happiness. A head, which is spread out, flat,
big and uneven, indicates misery.</p>

<p>84-85. The hair of a woman are indicative of good fortune. If
they are soft, black, long, thin and yellow, they indicate
misfortune. But honey-coloured hair of a fair complexioned woman
and black hair of a dark complexioned woman are also considered
auspicious. Most of the characteristic features, described in
this chapter, apply to men also.</p>

<h2><a name=82>Ch. 82. Effects of Moles, Marks, Signs etc. for Men and
Women</a></h2>

<p>1. Maharishi Parasara said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe
to you the effects of moles, marks, spots and signs, found on
the body of women and men.</p>

<p>2-3. A mole, spot, or figure, formed by hair on the left side
of a woman and right side of a man is auspicious. If there is
mole on the chest of a woman, she will be fortunate. A woman,
who has a red mark, like a mole etc., on her right breast,
begets many children and she is blessed with all kinds of
enjoyments and comforts.</p>

<p>4. The woman, who has a red mark (mole) on her left breast,
begets only one son.</p>

<p>5. The woman, who has a mole on her right breast, begets many
daughters and sons.</p>

<p>6. There will be gain, or acquisition of a kingdom, if there,
as is a red mole etc. on the forehead, or in the middle of
(between) the eyebrows. The person will enjoy sweetish
preparations, if there is such a mark on the cheeks.</p>

<p>7-10. The woman, who has a red mark (mole etc.) on her nose,
becomes consort of a king. If the mark be blackish, the woman
concerned becomes an adulteress, or widow. All the marks below
the navel are auspicious for both men and women. If there be
moles etc. on the ears, cheeks, or neck of a man, his first
issue will be male and he will enjoy good fortune and happiness.
The man, who has moles etc. in the thighs, suffers misery.</p>

<p>11. The woman, who has the sign of trident on her forehead,
becomes a queen. Such a mark on the forehead of a man makes him
a king.</p>

<p>12. A right-turned circular hair formation on heart, navel,
hands, right part of the back and in the portion between sex
organ and navel is auspicious. Left-turned formation is
inauspicious.</p>

<p>13-14. Such a hair formation on the waist and private parts
proves inauspicious. If such a formation be on the stomach, the
woman concerned will become a widow. If it be in the center of
the back she will become an adulteress. It will be inauspicious,
if it be on the neck, forehead, or center of the head.</p>

<p>15. A man with indications of short life will get his
longevity prolonged by marrying a woman with auspicious, or
lucky marks/symbols.</p>

<h2><a name=83>Ch. 83. Effects of Curses in the Previous Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-3. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! You have acquainted me
with effects, experienced by men and women in a number of ways.
According to Shastras, the soul of a person does not rest in
peace after his death, if he is not blessed with a son. What sin
does a person commit to remain without a son? And what are the
remedial measures to be adopted by him to get a son? Kindly
enlighten me about this.</p>

<p>4. Maharishi Parasara replied. I will now tell you, whatever
Lord Shiva told Goddess Parvati in this respect.</p>

<p>5. Goddess Parvati said to Lord Shiva. O my Lord! What is the
sin, which causes destruction of children amongst men. Please
tell me, what are the Yogas for such an effect and what are the
remedial measures to protect the children?</p>

<p>6. Lord Shiva replied: O Devi! You have asked a very relevant
question. Now I will tell you the Yogas for loss of children and
the requisite remedial measures.</p>

<p>7. A person will be without a son, if Guru, the Lord of Lagn
and the Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> are all devoid of
strength.</p>

<p>8. The same will happen, if S&#363;rya, Mangal, Rahu and
&#346;ani, endowed with strength, be in the 5<sup>th</sup> and
the significator for children, namely Guru and Lord of the
5<sup>th</sup> etc. be bereft of strength.</p>

<p>9-16. There will be no male issue, due to the curse of a
serpent, if at birth Rahu is in the 5<sup>th</sup>, aspected by
Mangal; the Lord of 5<sup>th</sup> is associated with Rahu and
Candr is in the 5<sup>th</sup> and is aspected by &#346;ani; the
significator for children (Guru) is associated with Rahu, the
Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> is devoid of strength and the Lord of
Lagn is with Mangal; the significator for children is associated
with Mangal, Lagn is occupied by Rahu and the Lord of the
5<sup>th</sup> is in 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, or
12<sup>th</sup>; Budh, as Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup>, being in
the Navams of Mangal, is associated with Mangal and Lagn is
occupied by Rahu and Gulika; the 5<sup>th</sup> is Mesh, or
Vrischik and the Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> is associated with
Rahu, or Budh; the 5<sup>th</sup> is occupied by S&#363;rya,
&#346;ani, Mangal, Rahu, Budh and Guru and the Lords of the
5<sup>th</sup> and Lagn are devoid of strength; the Lord of
Lagn, or Guru is associated with Rahu and the Lord of the
5<sup>th</sup> is in conjunction with Mangal.</p>

<p>17-19. Remedial measures should be adopted to obtain
protection from the evil effects of the above Yogas. These are
getting an idol of Naga (serpent) Raja, made in gold and, after
worshipping it in accordance with prescribed procedure, giving
in charity a cow, some land, sesame seeds and gold etc. By
adopting these measures the Lord of Serpents will be gratified
and by his beneficence the person concerned will be blessed with
a son and the lineage of his family will be prolonged.</p>

<p>20-30. There will be no male issue, as a result of the curse
of the father in the previous birth, if at birth of the native
S&#363;rya in his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i and in the Navams
of &#346;ani is hemmed in between malefics in the 5<sup>th</sup>
Bhava; S&#363;rya, as Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup>, posited in a
Trikon with a malefic, is hemmed in between malefics and is also
aspected by a malefic; Guru occupies the R&#257;&#347;i of
S&#363;rya, the Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> is with S&#363;rya
and Lagn and the 5<sup>th</sup> are occupied by malefics; Lord
of Lagn, devoid of strength, is in the 5<sup>th</sup> and the
Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> is combust and Lagn and the
5<sup>th</sup> are occupied by malefics; there is exchange of
Bhavas between Lords of the 5<sup>th</sup> and the
10<sup>th</sup> and Lagn and the 5<sup>th</sup> are occupied by
malefics; Mangal, as the Lord of the 10<sup>th</sup>, is
associated with the Lord of the 5<sup>th</sup> and Lagn, the
5<sup>th</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> are occupied by malefics;
Lord of the 10<sup>th</sup> is in the 6<sup>th</sup>,

<p>31-33. To get deliverance form the curse of the father the
remedial measures are performance of Shraddha at Gaya; to feed
ten thousand, one thousand, or 100 Brahmins, as one can afford;
Kanyadana (to perform the marriage of a girl); giving a cow in
charity. By observing these remedial measures, the person
concerned becomes free from the curse and the family lineage is
prolonged by the birth of sons, grandsons etc.</p>

<p>Note. In this chapter, where the words ‘childlessness’ and
‘issue-lessness’ are used, they should be interpreted to mean
want of male issue, because it is the male issue, who by
performing the last rites of his father and mother ensures
eternal peace to their souls.</p>

<p>34-50. A person will be without a male issue, as a result of
curse of the mother, if at birth Candr, as Lord of the
5<sup>th</sup> is in her debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, or is
hemmed in between malefics and 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
are occupied by malefics; &#346;ani is in 11<sup>th</sup>,

issue the person concerned should take bath in the sea with
bridge of rocks between India and Sri Lanka, recite one Lakh
Gayatri Mantras, give in charity things, connected with evil
Grahas, feed Brahmins and go round a Pipal tree 1008 times. By
performing these remedial measures, he will not only beget a
son, the lineage of family will also be prolonged.</p>

<p>51-61. A person will be without a male issue, as result of
the curse of the brother, if at birth Lord of 3<sup>rd</sup>
with Rahu and Mangal is in 5<sup>th</sup> and Lords of Lagn and
5<sup>th</sup> are in 8<sup>th</sup>; Lagn and 5<sup>th</sup>
are occupied by Mangal and &#346;ani, respectively, the Lord of

<p>62-64. The person concerned will, without doubt, get release
from the curse, will be blessed with a son and the prolongation
of his family lineage will be ensured, if the following remedial
measures are adopted. He should observe the Candryana fast after
listening to Haribansa Puran. He should plant a sapling of Pipal
in front of Saligram on the banks of the Caveri river, or on the
Ganga, or Mahanadi and offer prayers to it. He should give 10
cows in charity through his wife. He should give in charity land
with mango trees, planted on it.</p>

<p>65-68. A person will be without a male issue, as a result of
the curse of the maternal uncle, if at birth the 5<sup>th</sup>
is occupied by Budh, Guru, Mangal and Rahu and &#346;ani is in
Lagn; the 5<sup>th</sup> is occupied by the Lords of Lagn and of

with a son and for ensuring the prolongation of the lineage of
the family the following remedial measures are to be adopted.
Installation of an idol of Lord Vishnu. Construction of a deep,
or ordinary well, dam, or reservoir, or all of them.</p>

<p>71-78. If a person, mad with power and wealth, insults a
Brahmin, he remains without a male issue in the next birth. A
person will be without a male issue, as a result of the curse of
a Brahmin, if at birth Rahu is in Guru’s R&#257;&#347;i and Guru
in 5<sup>th</sup>; Lord of 9<sup>th</sup> is in 5<sup>th</sup>
and Lord of 5<sup>th</sup> in 8<sup>th</sup> along with Guru,

associated with &#346;ani and Mangal and the Lord of
5<sup>th</sup> is in 12<sup>th</sup>; Guru is associated with
&#346;ani in Lagn and Rahu is in 9<sup>th</sup>, or Rahu is with
Guru in 12<sup>th</sup>. These are Yogas, which reveal the curse
of Brahmin in the previous birth.</p>

<p>79-81. To obtain relief from the evil effects of the above
Yogas the remedial measures are to observe Candrayana fast and
to do penance three times and to give in charity a cow and five
gems with gold, after feeding Brahmins, according to one’s means
and giving them presents in cash. Then the person will be
released from the curse and will be endowed with happiness.</p>

<p>82-92. A person does not beget a male issue, as a result of
the curse of the wife, if at birth Lord of Lagn is in
5<sup>th</sup>, &#346;ani in the Navams of Lord of
7<sup>th</sup> and Lord of 5<sup>th</sup> in 8<sup>th</sup>;
Lord of 7<sup>th</sup> is in 8<sup>th</sup>, Lord of
12<sup>th</sup> in 5<sup>th</sup> and Guru is associated with a
malefic; &#346;ukr is in 5<sup>th</sup>, Lord of 7<sup>th</sup>
in 8<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> is occupied by a malefic;
the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> are occupied by a malefic
and Lord of 7<sup>th</sup> is in 8<sup>th</sup>; &#346;ukr is in
9<sup>th</sup>, Lord of 7<sup>th</sup> in 8<sup>th</sup> and
Lagn and 5<sup>th</sup> are occupied by malefics; &#346;ukr is
Lord of 9<sup>th</sup>, Lord of 5<sup>th</sup> is in an inimical

Lagn, respectively, and Guru is associated with a malefic; Rahu
is in Lagn, &#346;ani in 5<sup>th</sup>, Mangal in
9<sup>th</sup> and Lords of 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>
are in 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>93-94. The person concerned gets release from the curse and
is blessed with a son, if he performs the marriage of an
unmarried girl, or, if such a girl is not available, a gold idol
of the Lakshminarayana, fertile cow, a bed, ornaments and
garments to a Brahmin couple.</p>

<p>Notes. According to our view, ‘Kanyadana’ does not mean
giving a girl in charity, but helping in the performance of the
marriage of an unmarried girl, not his own daughter.</p>

<p>95-105. If the person, whose duty is to do so, does not
perform Shraddha of his father, or mother in his previous birth,
the departed soul is formed into an evil spirit and he is
deprived of a male issue in the next birth. This is revealed by
the following Yogas at birth.  &#346;ani and S&#363;rya in
5<sup>th</sup>, waning Candr in 7<sup>th</sup> and Rahu and Guru
in 12<sup>th</sup>; &#346;ani, as Lord of 5<sup>th</sup> in
8<sup>th</sup>, Mangal in Lagn and Guru in 8<sup>th</sup>;
Malefics are in Lagn, S&#363;rya in 12<sup>th</sup>, Mangal,
&#346;ani and Budh are in 5<sup>th</sup> and the Lord of
5<sup>th</sup> is in 8<sup>th</sup>; Rahu is in Lagn, &#346;ani

and Guru are in their debilitation R&#257;&#347;is, aspected by
debilitated Grahas; &#346;ani is in Lagn, Rahu in
5<sup>th</sup>, S&#363;rya in 8<sup>th</sup> and Mangal in
12<sup>th</sup>; Lord of 7<sup>th</sup> is in 6<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup>, or 12<sup>th</sup>, Candr is in 5<sup>th</sup>,
&#346;ani and Gulika are in Lagn; Lord of 8<sup>th</sup> along
with &#346;ani and &#346;ukr is in 5<sup>th</sup> and Guru is in
his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>106-108. The person concerned gets release from the curse and
is blessed with a son, if he undertakes the following remedial
measures. Performance of a Pinda Dana, Rudra Abhisheka, giving
in charity a gold idol of Brahma, a cow, a vessel, made of
silver and a Neelamani, feeding Brahmins and giving them
presents in cash.</p>

<p>109-111. If a person is deprived of a male issue, as a result
of malevolence of Grahas at birth, he will be blessed with a
son, if he undertakes the following remedial measures.
Worshipping Lord Shiva, if the harm is, as a result of the
malevolence of Budh and &#346;ukr; reciting of Santan Gopal
Mantra, wearing and worshipping appropriate Yantra and taking
suitable medicines, if the childlessness is a result of the
malevolence of Guru and Candr; Kanya Dana, if the childlessness
is due to malevolence of Rahu; worshipping of Lord Vishnu, if it
is due to malevolence of S&#363;rya; Rudriya Japa, if it is due
to the malevolence of Mangal and &#346;ani. Listening with
devotion to Haribansh Puran removes all kinds of blemishes and
blesses the person concerned with a son.</p>

<h2><a name=84>Ch. 84. Remedial Measures from the Malevolence of
Grahas</a></h2>

<p>1. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! Please describe for the
good of mankind the remedial measures for appeasement of the
malevolent Grahas.</p>

<p>2. The Sage replied. I have already described the names and
characteristic features and qualities of the Grahas.  Joys and
sorrows of all the creatures in the world are dependent on these
Grahas. Therefore persons desirous of peace, wealth and
prosperity, rainfall, good health and longevity should worship
the Grahas (by prayers, recitation of Mantras, charity
etc.).</p>

<p>3-5. For the purpose of worshipping them the idols of
S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr, &#346;ani,
Rahu and Ketu should be made of copper, Sphatika (rock crystal),
red sandal wood, gold (both Budh and Guru), silver, iron, glass
and bell metal, respectively. Alternatively the sketches of all
the above Grahas should be drawn in the colours, belonging to
them, on a piece of cloth by sandal etc. and they should be
placed in their own directions.</p>

<p>6. Contemplate of S&#363;rya well adorned with two arms,
seated on a lotus, with a lotus flower in one hand,
red-coloured, like lotus and aboard a chariot of seven
horses.</p>

<p>7. Contemplate of Candr white-coloured, dressed in white
robes, with two arms, carrying a mace in one hand and a Vara in
the other, adorned with white-coloured ornaments and aboard a
chariot of ten horses.</p>

<p>8. Contemplate of Mangal with a red necklace, dressed in
red-coloured robes, with four arms, carrying Shakti, Shoola,
Gada (mace) and Vara and mounted on a lamb.</p>

<p>9. Contemplate of Budh with a yellow-coloured garland,
dressed in yellow robes, with four arms, carrying a sword, a
shield, a mace and Vara, mounted on a lion.</p>

<p>10. Contemplate of Guru, as yellow complexion and &#346;ukr
of fair complexion, both with four arms, carrying a Danda,
Akshasutra, Kamandal and Vara.</p>

<p>11. O Maitreya! Contemplate of &#346;ani with the lustre,
like that of Indraneela, with four arms, carrying Shoola, bow,
arrow and Vara, mounted on a donkey.</p>

<p>12. Contemplate of Rahu with a hideous face, with four arms,
carrying a sword, a shield, a Shoola and a Vara, blue-coloured
and mounted on a lion.</p>

<p>13. There are many Ketus. All of them are of smoky colour,
with two arms, carrying a mace and a Vara, with a hideous face
and mounted on a donkey.</p>

<p>14. All the idols should be so made, that they are 108
fingers tall by one’s own fingers.</p>

<p>Notes. Such a measurement is taken from the middle
finger.</p>

<p>15-16. Dedicate with devotion to the Grah concerned the
flowers and garments of the colour, belonging to him, sandal,
Deep, Guggul etc., his metal and the grains, dear to him and
distribute all these things to Brahmins to appease the Grah.</p>

<p>17-20. The Mantras of all the Grahas and the prescribed
number of their recitation are given below. The recitation of
Mantras should be done after worshipping the Grahas, as
indicated in verses 15-16. Grah Mantra prescribed number:
S&#363;rya 7000, Candr 11000, Mangal 11000, Budh 9000, Guru
19000, &#346;ukr 16000, &#346;ani 23000, Rahu 18000, Ketu
17000.</p>

<p>21-22. Havan should be performed with Aak, Palash, Khair,
Chirchiri, Pipal, Goolar, Shami wood pieces, Doob and Kush, for
S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr, &#346;ani,
Rahu and Ketu, respectively, mixed with honey, Gh&#299;, curd,
or milk. The number of offerings to the sacred fire is 108, or
28.</p>

<p>23-24. To appease S&#363;rya and the other eight Grahas
Brahmins should be fed with (cream) of rice cooked with jaggery,
rice cooked in milk, Havishya, paddy cooked in milk, curd and
rice, rice with Gh&#299;, rice cooked with powder of sesame
seeds, rice cooked with meat, rice cooked with cereals,
respectively.</p>

<p>25. To appease S&#363;rya and other Grahas the things to be
given in charity are cow with calf, conch, bullock, gold, robes,
horse, black cow, weapons made of iron and goat,
respectively.</p>

<p>26-27. The Grah, who is the cause of adverse effects to a
person at any time, should be handled by worship and appeasing
(of the benevolent ones), because Brahma has blessed the Grahas
with the boon “Do to the persons, who worship you”. And the
development and progress and downfall of the people and the
creation and destruction of the universe are all under the
administration and authority of the Grahas. Therefore they are
most venerable.</p>

<h2><a name=85>Ch. 85. Inauspicious Births</a></h2>

<p>1-4. The Venerable Sage said. O Maitreya!  Now I will
describe to you the circumstances, in which the births are
inauspicious in spite of Lagn and the Grahas being well
disposed. Although Lagn may be well disposed, births will be
inauspicious, if they take place on Amavasya (last day of the
Krishna Paksha), on Chaturdasi (14<sup>th</sup> Tithi), in
Krishna Paksha (dark half of the month), in Bhadra Karan, in the
Nakshatr of the brother, in the Nakshatras of father and mother,
at the time of entry of S&#363;rya in a R&#257;&#347;i, the time
of Pata, at the time of solar and lunar eclipses, at the time of
Vyati Pata, in Gandantas of all the three kinds, in Yamaghant,
Tithikshaya, in Dagdha Yog etc. The birth of a son after three
daughters and birth of a daughter after three sons and the birth
of a freak are inauspicious. But there are remedial measures for
obtaining relief from the evil effects of such births, which are
being described in the following chapters.</p>

<h2><a name=86>Ch. 86. Remedies for Amavasya Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-9. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya!  The person, born on
Amavasya, is always poverty stricken. It is therefore essential
to adopt remedial measures to obtain relief from the evil
effects of such births, which are, as follows. Take a Kalash
(water vessel) and then put in it fresh leaves of Goolar (wild
fig), Vata (banyan), Pipal, mango and Neema (mango) trees and
cover it with two pieces of cloth. Then install the Kalash in
the South-West direction after reciting … etc. and … etc.
Mantras. Then worship the idols of S&#363;rya and Candr, ruling
deities of Amavasya, made of gold and silver, mixed with copper,
respectively, by recitation of … etc. Mantras for S&#363;rya and
… etc. Mantras for Candr 16, or 5 times. Thereafter perform
Havan with 108, or 28 oblations of the mixture of prescribed
fuels (…) and cooked food (Charu) with recitation of Mantras of
S&#363;rya and Candr. Later sprinkle the water on the child,
that is born and his parents and offer in charity gold, silver
and a black cow together with feeding the Brahmins, according to
one’s means. By performing these remedial rites the child born
gains freedom and protection from the evil effects of the birth
on Amavasya.</p>

<h2><a name=87>Ch. 87. Remedies from Birth on Krishna Chaturdashi</a></h2>

<p>1-3. The Sage said. Divide the span of Chaturdashi in 6
parts. The birth in the first part is auspicious. Second part
causes destruction, or death of father. Third part causes death
of the mother.  Fourth part takes away the maternal uncle. Fifth
part destroys the entire family (Khula - generation). Sixth part
causes loss of wealth, or destruction (death) of the native.
Therefore it is essential to take immediate remedial measures to
escape these evil effects.</p>

<p>4-5. Have an idol of Lord Shiva, made of one Karsha (equal in
weight to the former silver Rupee) of gold, or of weight one can
afford. The idol should have a New Moon on the forehead, have a
white garland round the neck, have three eyes (one being on the
forehead), be dressed in white robes, be seated on a bull, be
two-armed and carry Vara and Abhaya.</p>

<p>6-13. Then after invocation with Varun Mantra worship should
be performed by chanting … etc. Mantras. Thereafter a Kalash
should be placed in the North-East direction with chanting of
‘Imah Mai Varun’, ‘Tan Tva Yami’, ‘Tvan Nai Agni’ Mantras,
followed by Japa of … etc. and ‘Bhadra Agni …’ Suktas and the
chanting of … Mantra. Then, after sprinkling water over the idol
of Lord Shiva (Abhisheka), the nine Grahas should be worshipped.
This should be followed by Havan, by using Gh&#299;, powder of
sesame seeds, Urda, Sarson and wood pieces of Pipal, Pakar,
Palas and Khadir trees. 108, or 28 oblations should be made
separately for the nine Grahas.  Thereafter, along with chanting
of … etc. Mantras, Havan should be performed with sesame seeds
for the nine Grahas. Lastly the water of the Kalash should be
sprinkled on the native and his parents and the Brahmins should
be fed, according to means.</p>

<h2><a name=88>Ch. 88. Remedies from Birth in Bhadra and Inauspicious
Yogas</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to describe the
remedial measures for relief from the evil effects of birth in
Bhadra, Tithi Kshaya, Vyatipata, Paridha, Vajra etc.
inauspicious Yogas and Yamaghants etc. The remedial rites should
be performed on the day, when the same inauspicious Yog operates
again.</p>

<p>3-5. The remedial rites are to be performed in the following
order by the parents of the child in the above inauspicious
Yogas. Puja of Lord Vishnu and other deities on an auspicious
day and auspicious Lagn on the advice of a proficient Jyotishi,
burning of Deep with Gh&#299; in a Shiva temple, Abhisheka of
Lord Shiva, going round a Pipal tree 108 times prolongs
longevity and perform Havan with 108 oblations along with the
recital of ‘Vaisneh Raratmachityadhi’ Mantra of Lord Vishnu and
feeding Brahmins to the best of one’s means. The observance of
these remedial measures will give deliverance to the native from
all the evil effects of his inauspicious birth and he will enjoy
happiness.</p>

<h2><a name=89>Ch. 89. Remedies from Nakshatr Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-7. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya! If the birth takes
place in the Nakshatras of the brother and the parents, death
takes place, without doubt, of the brother and the father, or
mother, or they have to undergo death-like suffering. Therefore
I am going to describe the remedial measures to be adopted to
escape from these evil effects. The remedial rites should be
performed in a Muhurta, when Candr and stars are favourable on a
day, on which there is no Rikta-Bhadra Dosha. The remedial rites
should be performed in the following order. Instal an idol of
the Janm Nakshatr on a Kalash in the North-East direction from
the fire. Cover it with a red piece of cloth and then warp two
pieces of cloth round it. Worship the idol by chanting the
Mantras of the Janm Nakshatr. According to one’s Gotra, perform
Havan 108 times with the recitation of the same Mantra, facing
the fire, with Gh&#299; and other Havan material. Then the
priest, performing the Puja, should sprinkle water on the
parents and brother (whoever is concerned). Give presents in
cash (Dakshena) to the priest and his colleagues, associated
with the ceremony, to the best of one’s means and then feed the
Brahmins to the best of one’s means.</p>

<h2><a name=90>Ch. 90. Remedies from Sankranti Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! The names of the Sankranti on
the seven days of the week, beginning from Sunday, are Ghora,
Dhavankshi, Mahodari, Manda, Mandakini, Mishra and Rakshasi. The
person, born at the Sankranti (entry of S&#363;rya in a new
R&#257;&#347;i), is poor and unhappy, but he becomes well-to-do
and happy, if remedial measures are undertaken. I am now going
to describe the remedial measures to nullify these evil
effects.</p>

<p>3-6. The Yagya of the nine Grahas should be performed to
obtain relief from the evil effects of the birth at Sankranti. A
clean spot in the eastern part of the house should be purified
by besmearing with cow dung. Then prepare three separate heaps
of the following: 5 Dronas (80 Seers) of paddy (Sadhi),
2&frac12; Dronas (40 Seers) of rice, 1&frac14; Dronas (20 Seers)
of sesame seeds (Til). On these heaps of grains make a figure of
lotus with eight leaves (Ashtamdhal) and then decorate them with
flowers. After doing this, select and invite a priest, who is
well versed in the performance of religious rites and recitation
of Mantras.</p>

<p>7-18. The religious rites are then to be performed in the
following order. Install Kalashas without any holes on all the
three heaps and put in each of them water from holy places,
Saptamrattika, Shataushadhi, Panchapallava and Panchagavya. Then
wrap the Kalashas with pieces of cloth. Place small earthen
pots, wrapped with thin cloth, on the Kalashas.  Then install
the idol of Sankranti along with the idol of Adhideva and
Pratyadhideva. (Here S&#363;rya is Adhideva and Candr
Pratyadhideva). Their idols should be placed on either side of
the main idols of Sankranti. Two robes may be given, as offering
to each of the idols. Perform worship of all the three idols,
according to the prescribed procedure. The main idol should be
worshipped with the chanting of ‘Trayambakam’, ‘Yajam Hai’ etc.,
the idol of S&#363;rya with Mantra ‘Ut S&#363;rya’ and the idol
of Candr with Mantra ‘Apayayashava’ etc. The worship should be
performed with Shodshopchar, or Panchopchar, as may be possible.
After touching the main idol, Mrityunjaya Japa should be recited
1008, 108, or 28 times, as may be possible. Make a small
platform in the West of the installed Kalashas, kindle fire on
it and perform the prescribed rites. Then perform Havan 1008,
108, or 28 times with Samidha, Ghrit (Gh&#299;) and Charu
(powder of Til) within one’s means along with chanting of
‘Trayambakam’ etc. Mantra. 8) Again perform Havan, first with
the fuel of sesame seeds along with recitation of Mrityunjaya
Mantra. After performing another Svistkrita Havan, sprinkle the
holy water on the child born and his parents. Lastly feed as
many Brahmins, as one can afford. By performing the remedial
rites, described above, the evil effects are nullified and the
native and his parents enjoy happiness.</p>

<h2><a name=91>Ch. 91. Remedies for Birth in Eclipses</a></h2>

<p>1-14. The Sage said. O Brahmin! A person, whose birth takes
place at the time of solar, or lunar eclipse, suffers from
ailments, distress and poverty and faces danger of death.
Therefore I am going to describe for the benefit of the mankind
the remedial measures, required to be undertaken to nullify the
above evil effects. The remedial rites are to be performed in
the following order. The following idols should be got prepared,
according to one’s means: in gold an idol of the deity of the
Nakshatr, in which the eclipse takes place (regarding deities of
Nakshatras, see ‘notes’ of verse 18, Ch. 3, Vol. I); in gold an
idol of S&#363;rya, if the birth takes place during solar
eclipse; in silver an idol of Candr, if the birth takes place
during lunar eclipse; in lead an idol of Rahu. Besmear a clean
spot on the ground (in the house) with cow dung, cover it with a
new (unused) beautiful piece of cloth and install the three
idols on it. Make offerings of the following to the idols: in
case of birth during solar eclipse all things dear to S&#363;rya
and red-coloured Akshat (Akshata - rice), red sandal, a garland
of red-coloured flowers, red clothes etc.; in case of birth
during a lunar eclipse all things dear to Candr and white
sandal, white flowers, white clothes etc.; for Rahu blackish
clothes, blackish flowers etc.; white flowers for the deity of
the Nakshatr, in which the eclipse takes place. The worship
should be performed, as follows: of S&#363;rya with the chanting
of ‘Akrishnim’ etc.  Mantra; of Candr with the chanting of
‘Imadeva’ etc. Mantra; of Rahu with Durva (a kind of grass) and
with the chanting of ‘Kayanshicatra’ etc. Mantra.  Thereafter
Havan should be performed, as follows: with the fuel of Aak wood
pieces for S&#363;rya; with the fuel of Palas tree wood pieces
for Candr; with Durva for Rahu; with Pipal tree wood pieces for
the deity of the Nakshatr.  Sprinkle the holy water of the
Kalash on the child born (and his parents).  Offer worshipful
regards to the priest, performing the remedial rites and lastly
feed as many Brahmins, as possible within one’s means. By
performance of the remedial rites in the manner described above,
evil effects of the inauspicious birth are wiped and the native
enjoys happiness and is blessed with good fortune.</p>

<h2><a name=92>Ch. 92. Remedies from Gandanta Birth</a></h2>

<p>1. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Gandanta is of three kinds,
namely of Tithi, Nakshatr and Lagn. Birth, travelling and
performance of auspicious functions, like marriage etc., during
Gandanta are likely to cause death of the person concerned.</p>

<p>2. O Maitreya! The last 2 Ghatikas of Purna Tithi
(5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>) and the first
2 Ghatikas of Nanda Tithi (1<sup>st</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>,
11<sup>th</sup>) are known, as Tithi Gandanta.</p>

<p>3. Similarly the last two Ghatikas of Revati and first two
Ghatikas of Ashvini, the last two Ghatikas of Aslesha and first
two Ghatikas of Magha and the last two Ghatikas of Jyeshtha and
first two Ghatikas of Mula are known, as Nakshatr Gandanta.</p>

<p>4. The last half Ghatika of Meen and first half Ghatika of
Mesh, the last half Ghatika of Kark and first half Ghatika of
Simh, the last half Ghatika of Vrischik and first half Ghatika
of Dhanu are known, as Lagn Gandanta.</p>

<p>5. Amongst these Gandantas the last 6 Ghatikas of Jyeshtha
and first 8 Ghatikas of Mula are known, as Abhukta Mula.</p>

<p>6-8. Now I will tell you the remedial measures to be adopted
to release the child, born during Gandanta, from its evil
effects. The father should see the child born only on the
morning next to the end of the days of Sutaka, or on any
auspicious day after the performance of the remedial measures.
The remedial measures are giving a bullock in charity in the
case of Tithi Gandanta, giving a cow with calf in charity in the
case of Nakshatr Gandanta, giving gold in charity in the case of
Lagn Gandanta, performing Abhisheka of the child along with
father, if the birth is in the first part of Gandanta and along
with mother, if the birth is in the second part of Gandanta.</p>

<p>9-11. Performance of Puja on the holy Kalash of the idol of
the deities of Tithi (in case of Tithi Gandanta), Nakshatr (in
case of Nakshatr Gandanta) and Lagn (in case of Lagn Gandanta),
made of 16 Masas, 8 Masas, or 4 Masas of gold, as may be
possible, followed by Havan and Abhisheka, according to
procedure already described earlier. At the end as many
Brahmins, as may be possible within one’s means, should be fed.
These remedial measures will ensure long life, good health and
prosperity for the child.</p>

<p>Notes. Unless one is himself fully conversant with the
performance of religious rites, the remedies, recommended in
this chapter, earlier and later chapters, should be got
performed by and under the directions of a learned priest,
because the full effects will be derived, if the rites are
performed correctly and according to the procedure, prescribed
in the religious scriptures on this subject.</p>

<h2><a name=93>Ch. 93. Remedies for Abhukta Mula Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The Sage Parasara said. The ruling deity of Jyeshtha is
Indra and the ruling deity of Mula is Rakshasa. As both the
deities are inimical to each other, this Gandanta is considered,
as the most evil. A boy, or girl, born during the period of
Abhukta Mula, should either be abandoned, or the father should
not see the face of the child for 8 years. Now I shall describe
the remedial measures to obtain deliverence from the evil
effects of birth during this extremely inauspicious period.</p>

<p>3-4. In view of the extremely inauspicious effects of birth
during Abhukta I shall first describe the remedial measures to
obtain relief from Mula. The religious remedial rites should be
performed after the 12<sup>th</sup> day after the birth, the
next Janm Nakshatr day, or on an auspicious day, when Candr and
the stars are favourable.</p>

<p>5-8. Erect a canopy (Mandap) with four arched gateways,
embellished with festoons, on a sacred spot, besmeared with cow
dung paste, to the East, or North of the house. Prepare there a
pit (Kund), or place there a square vessel of clay, or metal for
performing Havan. Then, according to one’s means, prepare, or
get prepared an idol of Rakshasa of 16, 8, or 4 Masas of gold,
as may be possible within one’s means. The idol should be with a
horrible-looking face, black in colour, with two heads, two
arms, carrying a sword and a shield and seated on a dead
body.</p>

<p>9. In the absence of an idol a piece of gold of the weight,
mentioned above, should be used for worship, as gold is dear to
all the deities.</p>

<p>10-20. Thereafter the remedial rites should be performed in
the following order. Select a learned priest to perform the
religious rites, according to the prescribed procedure. Install
a Kalash and put in it Panchagavya (five articles, yielded by a
cow, namely milk, curd, Gh&#299;, dung and urine), Shataushadhi
and water of the holy river (Ganga etc.). Then install the idol
of the Rakshasa of Mula, facing West, on an earthen pot (Dhata)
with one hundred tiny holes. After placing bamboo leaves on it,
perform the worship of the idol by offering it white flowers,
sandal and clothes etc. Also perform worship of its Adhideva
Indra and Pratyadhideva Jal.  Then perform Havan to appease the
deities. According to one’s means, 1008, or 108 oblations should
be offered in the Havan. After this to obtain deliverence from
death Mrityunjaya Mantra etc. should be recited and prayers
offered to all the deities for the purpose of Abhisheka. The
father, mother and the child should thereafter take bath from
the water of the two Kalashas. Then the parents, dressed in
white clothes and with white sandal paste, besmeared on their
foreheads, should give a cow with calf, as a Dakshina to the
chief priest and feed the other priests and Brahmins, according
to one’s means. Lastly, after reciting the ‘Yatapapan’ etc. (see
verse 19) Mantra, the father, mother and the child should see
the reflection of their faces in the (melted) Gh&#299;. By the
performance of the remedial rites in the manner described all
evil effects of the birth during Abhukta Mula are completely
wiped out.</p>

<h2><a name=94>Ch. 94. Remedies from Jyeshtha Gandanta Birth</a></h2>

<p>1-5. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you
the remedial measures to be adopted to ensure relief from the
evil effects of Jyeshtha Gandanta. The erection of a canopy
(Mandhup), installation of Kalash, selection of a priest etc.
will be done in the same manner, as has been recommended for the
Abhukta Mula in the previous chapter.  In this ceremony Indra
will be the deity-in-chief, Adhideva will be Agni and the
Pratyadhideva will be Rakshasa.</p>

<p>6. Then the remedial rites should be performed in the
following order. Install on a Kalash, full of paddy rice, an
idol of gold with Indra, seated on Airavat with Vajra Ankusha in
his hands.  Perform worship of the chief deity Indra along with
that of the Adhideva and the Pratyadhideva with the recitation
of their appropriate Mantras. Perform Havan, Abhisheka and then
feed the Brahmins in accordance with one’s means. In addition to
the above, after doing Indrasukta and Mrityunjaya Japas, prayers
may be offered to Indra. These measures will wipe out the evil
effects of the Gandanta.</p>

<p>7. In case the performance of remedial rites, described
above, is beyond the means of any person, he should give a cow
in charity. This will also appease the deities and promote
relief from the evil effects of the Gandanta. Because the giving
of a cow in charity has been considered a superior remedial
measure than giving in charity all the lands, belonging to a
person.</p>

<p>8-9. According to prescribed remedial measures, 3 cows are to
be given in charity in the case of Jyeshtha-Mula and
Aslesha-Magha Gandantas, 2 cows in Revati-Ashvini Gandantas and
1 cow in other Gandantas, or in any inauspicious Yog. If cow, or
cows are not available, their actual value should be given in
cash to a Brahmin.</p>

<p>10. A girl, born in Jyeshtha Nakshatr, destroys (is the cause
of death of) the elder brother of her husband and a girl, born
in fourth quarter of Vishaka Nakshatr, destroys her husband’s
younger brother. Therefore a cow should be given in charity at
the time of the marriage of such girls to wipe out the
above-mentioned evil effects.</p>

<p>11-13. A boy, or girl, born in the 2<sup>nd</sup>,
3<sup>rd</sup>, or 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of Aslesha Nakshatr,
destroys his/her mother-in-law and a boy, or a girl, born in
1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of
Mula Nakshatr, becomes the destroyer of his/her father-in-law.
Therefore suitable measures, as may be possible within one’s
means, should be taken at the time of the marriage of such boys
and girls.  There will be no evil effect, if the husband has no
elder brothers.</p>

<h2><a name=95>Ch. 95. Remedies from Birth of a Daughter after Three
Sons</a></h2>

<p>1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! I will now tell you about
other kinds of inauspicious births. The birth of a daughter
after the birth of three sons, or the birth of a son after the
birth of three daughters is ominous for both the maternal and
paternal families of such children. Therefore remedial measures,
described below, may be taken to get deliverance from these evil
effects.</p>

<p>3-9. The rites should be performed on the morning next to the
last day of Sutak, or on any other auspicious day in the
following order. After selecting a priest and some Brahmins to
perform the remedial religious rites, the priest, after paying
obeisance to the nine Grahas, should install four Kalashas on a
heap of paddy, place the idols of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha and
Indra, made of gold, on them and perform their worship in the
prescribed manner. A Brahmin (an assistant of the priest), after
taking bath etc., should recite four Rudra Suktas and the whole
of Shanti Sukta. The priest should perform Havan with Samidha,
Gh&#299; and sesame seeds 1008, 108, or 28 times with the
recitation of the prescribed Mantras of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
and Indra. Svistkrata and Purnahuti and Abhisheka of the child
with his family should be done and presents in cash should be
given to the priest and his assistants, according to one’s
means. The Brahmins should be fed. The father and the mother of
the child should see their reflections in the Gh&#299;, kept in
a bronze vessel. Lastly grains and clothes should be distributed
to the poor and the needy. By the performance of the above
remedial rites the evil effects are wiped out and the child and
his parents etc. enjoy happiness.</p>

<h2><a name=96>Ch. 96. Remedies from Unusual Delivery</a></h2>

<p>1-3. The Sage said. O Brahmin! I will now tell you about
inauspicious and unusual deliveries by women, which are ominous
for the village, town and the country. These may be of the
following kinds.  Delivery of a child 2, 3, or 4 months earlier,
or later from the approximate due date. Delivery of a child
without hands, feet, or any other limbs, without head, or with
two heads. Delivery of an animal-shaped being by a woman, or a
human-shaped being by an animal.</p>

<p>4-5. Deliveries of these kinds by women, or cows etc. in a
house are ominous for all the members of the family, living
there. Therefore remedial measures are essential for obtaining
relief from their evil effects. The best remedial measure will
be to abandon (turn out from the Bhava) such women and animals
(cows, mares etc.).</p>

<p>6-9. It is considered inauspicious for a girl to become
pregnant, or to deliver a child in her 15<sup>th</sup>, or
16<sup>th</sup> year from birth. If a cow delivers, when
S&#363;rya is in Simh, or a female buffalo delivers, when
S&#363;rya is in Makar, they are disasterous to their owner and
the person, who looks after them. Therefore either such cow, or
buffalo should be given away to a Brahmin, or suitable remedial
measures should be taken to escape from the above-mentioned evil
effects. The remedial measures to be adopted are the same, as
given in verses 3-9 in Ch. 95.</p>

<p>10. Thus, whenever there is any kind of Aristha, adoption of
appropriate remedial measures will ensure long life, happiness
and prosperity for the person concerned.</p>

<h2><a name=97>Ch. 97. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>1-4. Maharishi Parasara said. O Brahmin! I have described to
you the Jyotish Shastra, as narrated by Lord Brahma to the Sage
Narada and by Narada to Shaunaka and other Sages, from whom I
received the knowledge of this Shastra. I have narrated the same
Jyotish Shastra, which I learnt from them. Do not impart the
knowledge of this Shastra to one, who is insignificative,
slanders, or calumniates others, nor to one, who is not
intelligent, is wicked and unknown to you. Teach this supreme
Vedanga Jyotish Shastra only to one, who is gentle and amiable,
devoted, truthful, brilliant and well known to you.</p>

<p>5-6. Only that person, who possesses adequate knowledge of
time and the positions of Grahas and Nakshatras, can understand
this Hora Shastra. Only that person, who has complete knowledge
of the Hora Sastra and who is truthful, can make correct
favourable, or unfavourable predictions.</p>

<p>7. One, who reads, or listens with attention and devotion to
this most excellent Hora Shastra, becomes long-lived and is
blessed with increase in his strength, wealth and good
reputation.</p>

<p>8-9. Thus was narrated by Mah&#257;rishi Par&#257;&#347;ara
to Maitreya this novel Hor&#257;&#347;&#257;stra, containing
invaluable and uncommon material from ancient scriptures on
Jyotish, for the benefit of the world at large.  Afterwards it
came into usage on the earth and received reverence from
all.</p>

<p>10-25. In these verses have been described the subject
matters of all the chapters, contained in this book and their
importance. This information has been given in detail in the
Table of Contents in Volumes I and II of this book.</p>
